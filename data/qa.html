      <p><b>User</b> (163 chars): Dante, in an email, has mentioned a UK project called Open Coin. It seems to go in a similar direction.<br/>Could there be synergies with bitcoin?<br/>http://opencoin.org/</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (494 chars): Could be. They're talking about the old Chaumian central mint stuff, but maybe only because that was the only thing available. Maybe they would be interested in going in a new direction.<br/>A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (903 chars): I have two questions, Satoshi.<br/>the first one ties in with Joerg's doubts about the trusted supply of tokens/coins.<br/>As far as I understand, there will be a limit of the total amount of tokens that can be created, and a changing gradient of difficulty in making the tokens, where the elaboration gets more and more difficult with time. Is that correct?<br/>It is important that there be a limit in the amount of tokens/coins. But it is also important that this limit be adjustable to take account of how many people adopt the system. If the number of users changes with time, it will also be necessary to change the total amount of coins.<br/>Is there a formula to decide on what should be the total amount of tokens, and if so, what is the formula?<br/>If there is no formula, who gets to make that decision and based on what criteria will it be made?<br/>I will keep my second question for later. One thing at a time...</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1466 chars): It is a global distributed database, with additions to the database by consent of the majority, based on a set of rules they follow:<br/>- Whenever someone finds proof-of-work to generate a block, they get some new coins<br/>- The proof-of-work difficulty is adjusted every two weeks to target an average of 6 blocks per hour (for the whole network)<br/>- The coins given per block is cut in half every 4 years<br/>You could say coins are issued by the majority. They are issued in a limited, predetermined amount.<br/>As an example, if there are 1000 nodes, and 6 get coins each hour, it would likely take a week before you get anything.<br/>To Sepp's question, indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.<br/>In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (454 chars): the network connection is used when you broadcast the information about the proof-of-work block you've created (that which entitles you to the new coin). Generating coins successfully requires constant connectivity, so that you can start working on the next block when someone gets the current block before you.<br/>Which stages require network connectivity, significant local CPU usage and or significant remote CPU usage? Do any of these stages have names?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1287 chars): 1) During generation (when the status bar says "Generating" and you're using CPU to find a proof-of-work), you must constantly keep in contact with the network to receive the latest block. If your block does not link to the latest block, it may not be accepted.<br/>It's important to have network connectivity while you're trying to generate a coin (block) and at the moment it is successfully generated.<br/>2) When you successfully generate a block, it is immediately broadcast to the network. Other nodes must receive it and link to it for it to be accepted as the new latest block.<br/>Think of it as a cooperative effort to make a chain. When you add a link, you must first find the current end of the chain. If you were to locate the last link, then go off for an hour and forge your link, come back and link it to the link that was the end an hour ago, others may have added several links since then and they're not going to want to use your link that now branches off the middle.<br/>After a block is created, the maturation time of 120 blocks is to make absolutely sure the block is part of the main chain before it can be spent. Your node isn't doing anything with the block during that time, just waiting for other blocks to be added after yours. You don't have to be online during that time.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (97 chars): Are there any plans to make this service anonymous?<br/>e.g; Being able to route BitCoin through Tor.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (194 chars): There will be a proxy setting in version 0.2 so you can connect through TOR. I've done a careful scrub to make sure it doesn't use DNS or do anything that would leak your IP while in proxy mode.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (131 chars): Someone correct me people, but I thought it IS already anonymous! Can the person I'm transferring money to know my IP or something?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (740 chars): When you send to a bitcoin address, you don't connect to the recipient. You send the transaction to the network the same way you relay transactions. There's no distinction between a transaction you originated and one you received from another node that you're relaying in a broadcast. With a very small network though, someone might still figure it out by process of elimination. It'll be better when the network is larger.<br/>If you send by IP, the recipient sees you because you connect to their IP. You could use TOR to mask that.<br/>You could use TOR if you don't want anyone to know you're even using Bitcoin.<br/>Bitcoin is still very new and has not been independently analysed. If you're serious about privacy, TOR is an advisable precaution.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (578 chars): Tor can be dangerous, like exit nodes that log information like passwords and the like.<br/>So a major question about the security of Bitcoin when using it with Tor (or any other proxy service) arises:<br/>So what exactly does Bitcoin send when it connects to an IP?Is everything encrypted that we send over the line?Can someone 'steal' bitcoins by listening at the end of a proxy (or in Tor's case an "exit node")?<br/>Speaking of security, we might just want to add a simple version checking procedure in bitcoin that will alert a user if s/he is running an "insecure version of bitcoin".</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (357 chars): True, sending by IP through Tor trades one problem for another. The Tor exit node can see the text of your message and potentially MITM you.<br/>Best to only send to bitcoin addresses then. Payments by bitcoin address are broadcast over the network as part of the normal network traffic. All communications with the network are broadcasts of public information.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (174 chars): Can nodes on the network tell from which and or to which bitcoin address coins are being sent? Do blocks contain a history of where bitcoins have been transfered to and from?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1327 chars): Bitcoins are sent to and from bitcoin addresses, which are essentially random numbers with no identifying information.<br/>When you send to an IP address, the transaction is still written to a bitcoin address. The IP address is only used to connect to the recipient's computer to request a fresh bitcoin address, give the transaction directly to the recipient and get a confirmation.<br/>Blocks contain a history of the bitcoin addresses that a coin has been transferred to. If the identities of the people using the bitcoin addresses are not known and each address is used only once, then this information only reveals that some unknown person transferred some amount to someone else.<br/>The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use. If you post your bitcoin address on the web, then you're associating that address and any transactions with it with the name you posted under. If you posted under a handle that you haven't associated with your real identity, then you're still pseudonymous.<br/>For greater privacy, it's best to use bitcoin addresses only once. You can change addresses as often as you want using Options-&gt;Change Your Address. Transfers by IP address automatically use a new bitcoin address each time.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (91 chars): Is there a command line option to enable the sock proxy the first time that bitcoin starts?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (625 chars): In the next release (version 0.2), the command line to run it through a proxy from the first time is:<br/>bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050<br/>The problem for TOR is that the IRC server which Bitcoin uses to initially discover other nodes bans the TOR exit nodes, as all IRC servers do. If you've already connected once before then you're already seeded, but for the first time, you'd need to provide the address of a node as such:<br/>bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=&lt;someipaddress&gt;<br/>If someone running a node with a static IP address that can accept incoming connections could post their IP to use for -addnode, that would be great.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (129 chars): What happens if you send bitcoins to an IP address that has multiple clients connected through network address translation (NAT)?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (448 chars): Whichever one you've set your NAT to forward port 8333 to will receive it. If your router can change the port number when it forwards, you could allow more than one client to receive. For instance, if port 8334 forwards to a computer's port 8333, then senders could send to "x.x.x.x:8334"<br/>If your NAT can't translate port numbers, there currently isn't a command line option to change the incoming port that bitcoin binds to, but I'll look into it.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1755 chars): Hey,<br/>First off I must say that this is an amazing concept. I have been dreaming of a P2P money system for a LONG time.<br/>You have my complete kudos and respect.<br/>I have a few suggestions:<br/>- When the bitcoin software establishes a connection with a peer (client TCP socket) have the client send the handshake string. Right now you have the server (server TCP socket) send the handshake. My reasons for this are anonymity of course. It is far too easy for ISPs to portscan clients and detect they are running this program.<br/>- Use some sort of encryption during the handshake (sort of goes with the statement/request above) to obfuscate what the software is during DPI (deep packet inspection). I am really thinking about people in non-free (as in freedom) countries such as China/Iran.<br/>- Some sort of an API is needed so that this system can be integrated with websites to provide instant-on services. A simple https receipt mechanism would do wonders. Have the client post each incoming payment to an https url with all of the relevant information and provide status updates. Also an outbound payment mechanism would be nice. So one could automate payments (and batch payments) outbound. Status could be returned via the https receipt interface.<br/>- Static port/Random port. Have a setting to randomly assign the port that it runs on. (also be able to set it statically for very restrictive firewalls).<br/>- UPnP support. Have the client automatically create the port forward on upstream routers. Enabled by default. Can be turned off in the options menu.<br/>- Ability to compile a headless (console only) install for *NIX systems. Also have the ability to just run as a network service. Perhaps with a telnet-able port for control (or even a unix socket would be ok).</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (224 chars): That's a good idea. The side accepting the connection just needs to withhold from sending anything until it receives a valid handshake. Any portscan would only get a dead connection that doesn't volunteer to identify itself.</p>

If we can get to the point where we have a working backend process that will run on FreeBSD I can run always-on seeds.<br/>I really think that having the download package contain a daily seed snapshot will improve the bootstrapping. I have seen instances on new test installs here where the application will sit with 0 connections / 1 block. Upon inspecting the debug.log I find that the IRC server (freenode, I believe) claims I am already connected and refuses to let me seed the application. (Just an example).<br/>I think that a simple network monitor plugin for Nagios would be helpful as well. Something that can emulate a connecting client, and retrieve a valid status code from the backend process. I have a lot of ideas.<br/>In any event, I would like to help. I have a lot of time and a project like this one is very exciting.<br/>Thanks for letting me be a part of it.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (118 chars): If we can get to the point where we have a working backend process that will run on FreeBSD I can run always-on seeds.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (960 chars): That would be a big help. TOR users wouldn't have to worry about how to get seeded, and we wouldn't depend on IRC.<br/>It can be run in a few simple modes without access to the UI if you don't mind a minimized window on the desktop. (0.1.5 doesn't have -min so it would be an open window)<br/>To only run a seed:<br/>bitcoin -min -gen=0<br/>You could sort of monitor it by looking at debug.log. To stop it, kill the process, the database won't mind.<br/>To generate:<br/>bitcoin -min -gen<br/>To get the generated bitcoins, you'd have to copy wallet.dat (with version 0.2) to a machine with a UI, swap in the wallet.dat, run bitcoin and transfer the coins to your main account. (With version 0.1.5 you'd have to copy the whole "%appdata%/Bitcoin" directory.) There is one caveat about copying wallet.dat: if you happened to kill the program at the exact moment that it generated a coin or received a payment, wallet.dat might not work by itself and you'd have to copy the whole directory.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (390 chars): I really think that having the download package contain a daily seed snapshot will improve the bootstrapping. I have seen instances on new test installs here where the application will sit with 0 connections / 1 block.

      <p><b>User</b> (221 chars): Suggestion :<br/>Since the coins are generated faster on fast machines, many people will want to use their GPU power to do this, too.<br/>So, my suggestion is to implement a GPU-computing support using ATI Stream and Nvidia CUDA.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (517 chars): The average total coins generated across the network per day stays the same. Faster machines just get a larger share than slower machines. If everyone bought faster machines, they wouldn't get more coins than before.<br/>We should have a gentleman's agreement to postpone the GPU arms race as long as we can for the good of the network. It's much easer to get new users up to speed if they don't have to worry about GPU drivers and compatibility. It's nice how anyone with just a CPU can compete fairly equally right now.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (323 chars): I think that breaking bitcoin into two apps is ideal. A wxwidgets front end (since it is mostly all there) and a backend that binds to a control TCP socket. I have been reading over the source to see how hard it would be to break it apart and I think it should be fairly simple. Of course an API would have to be developed.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (391 chars): My head hurts just thinking about that. Funnelling all the UI backend through a TCP connection would make everything twice as hard. There's too much bandwidth between the UI and the internal data structures in order to keep the listview control updated, because of the way the listview control works.<br/>I'd rather have command line control, that would get us remote admin and batch automation.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (913 chars): Hi. I would like to second the headless/non-GUI mode for /*nix/i systems. It would be useful to be able to start the Bitcoin software from an initscript or one's ~/.bashrc (or equivalent) file and let it run in the background, silently cranking away.<br/>Also, what would the feasibility of changing the location of the wallet.dat file be for the Win32 client? I ask this because I was playing around with the .zipped Windows Bitcoin client yesterday, and it struck me that it would make a good portable application. I was toying with the idea of decompressing it into a TrueCrypt volume on a USB drive so that it could, say, be taken on the road, run for a few hours, and then shut down just before the volume was unmounted, but it created the wallet.dat file in the C:\Documents and Settingsame\Application Data\Bitcoin directory. In effect, using a portable version of Bitcoin to eventually grow a portable wallet.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (810 chars): What you can currently do is set "Minimize to the tray" in options, then run it as "bitcoin -min" so it starts minimized. The only visible part will be a small (20x20) icon on the tray, which can be doubleclicked if you want to access the UI. Note: there's a bug with tray icons sometimes disappearing on 64-bit Karmic Koala, not sure if it's from 64-bit or Karmic, it was fine on 32-bit Jaunty.<br/>We didn't have time to implement the "Start Bitcoin on system startup" feature on Linux in time for 0.2 so it's greyed out. I figured Linux people wouldn't mind doing that manually anyway. I guess they need to know about the -min switch to do it right.<br/>You can locate the data directory where you want with the "-datadir=&lt;directory&gt;" switch. I know someone is already doing that to put it on a TrueCrypt USB drive.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (873 chars): Hi, yesterday I stumbled upon this great payment option.<br/>I read my way through many sites but now I have some questions that couldn't get answered.<br/>1. Is Bitcoin really anonymous? I mean totally and completely? Is my ISP able to detect, that I have sent or received a Bitcoin payment? Maybe he is even able to see that I am running Bitcoin right now?<br/>2. If I understood this correctly, my payment partners are not able to see who I am. Does this mean, they can not see my real IP adress? Only the Bitcoin-adress? Even if they monitors their network connections and stuff?<br/>3. If there is a way for my ISP to tell that I am running Bitcoin or for my payment partners to find out my IP, would it be more safe to tunnel the network traffic through a VPN (payed with Paysafecard for example)? Could this be dangerous, because the VPN provider will be able to capture my payment?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (180 chars): 1-3: For that level of anonymity you need to connect through TOR, which will be possible with version 0.2, which is only a few weeks away. I'll post TOR instructions at that time.<br/></p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1099 chars): Wow, thanks alot for these detailed answers.<br/>But today another question came to my mind.<br/>Lets say we know, that our neighbar uses Bitcoin, and we also know that he will receive a payment soon (maybe because he owns an internet shop and accepts bitcoin as payment option).<br/>Also, we know that he uses WLAN and his network is unsecured or weak protected. Same goes for router configuration.<br/>We now could log into his router configuration, change the ip adresses for the forwarded port 8333 to our system ip.<br/>Now every payment would be received by our bitcoin client.<br/>Is this actually going to work ?<br/>I know this is highly criminal and the scenario is .. well, lets call it "uncommon", but in theory it should work, right ?<br/>(Not that I have an interest in harming people, but I know that criminal people will try many ways to get some money.)<br/>BTW: same should work when you are on a LAN party with unprotected router config.<br/>Edit: Or are these scenarios totally impossible because no matter which ip adress uses the port, the payment will go to the bitcoin or ip adress that was defined from the payer ?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (425 chars): That's true, with the send-to-IP option, you are sending to whoever answers that IP. Sending to a bitcoin address doesn't have that problem.<br/>The plan is to implement an IP + bitcoin address option that would have the benefits of both. It would still use a different address for each transaction, but the receiver would sign the one-time-use address with the given bitcoin address to prove it belongs to the intended receiver.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (403 chars): The transfer is immediate if you send by IP address. If you send by bitcoin address and the recipient isn't online at the time, it might take 30 minutes or more to see it.<br/>Also, the recipient needs to be synced up with the block chain before it'll see the received transaction.

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (462 chars): I haven't tried compiling 64-bit yet. 64-bit wouldn't make it any faster, since it uses 64-bit numbers in only a few places and SHA-256 is a 32-bit algorithm, but it may be convenient for those running a 64-bit OS.

      <p><b>User</b> (563 chars): What exactly does the number of connections do for me? Do I generate more coins with more connections, or is it equivalent no matter what?<br/>It seems that from time to time, Tor gets tied up and can go for a few hours with 3 or 4 connections. Then, when I restart bitcoin or restart Tor to refresh my connections, I can get 7,8, or even more (9 currently).<br/>I haven't really been able to tell if coins generate slower or not with less connections, but I was curious if it does correlate. If not, how exactly will having more connections help me out compared to less?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (421 chars): Coins generate at the same speed with any number of connections &gt;= 1.<br/>More connections just add redundancy. If you only had one connection, what if that node is slow or busy, or only connected to you? Having several connections increases the certainty that you're well connected to the network. That hasn't been a problem in practice, the network is very thoroughly connected. If you have 2 or 3 connections, you're fine.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (741 chars): Hello,<br/>I have had another idea.<br/>It would be very cool to be able to have TOR and I2P seeds. For example: I could run BT within TOR-land on a .onion address. A client could connect their BT to TOR and have it seed from a .onion address and use it as a connected peer. (Likewise for I2P: someone could run a .i2p service that is -- well -- BC).<br/>I might setup a couple of nodes in this fashion and post the tunnels on this forum. I already run a lot of I2P and TOR nodes so adding BC to the mix is quite trivial.<br/>I support the idea of making BC compatible with TOR and I2P to increase the privacy of the system. I mean: why re-invent the wheel? There are thousands of mix network nodes just sitting there that can be used to enhance BC.<br/>Cheers!</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (490 chars): I've been thinking about that for a while. I want to add the backend support for .onion addresses and connecting to them, then go from there.<br/>There aren't many .onion addresses in use for anything because the user has to go through a number of steps to create one. Configure TOR to generate a .onion address, restart TOR, configure it with the generated address. Perhaps this is intentional to keep TOR so it can't be integrated into file sharing programs in any sufficiently automated way.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (913 chars): OK thanks riX.<br/>So, once Bitcoin has connected to at least one node then the -connect option will eliminate the 6667 warnings.<br/>Is Bitcoin using any kind of 'peer exchange' or DHT because this still does not seem to prevent the constant Tor 'exit' warnings and therefore Tor's requirement to try a new 'exit' node for connection. (which is problematic ! For Tor anyway, not Bitcoin ) This is really what I meant by "However, Bitcoin must try to connect with all nodes to check its not missing any blocks ?" I just communicated it incorrectly.<br/>I2P would seem to be a much easier solution to implement to increase a Bitcoins users anonymity.<br/>http://forum.i2p2.de/viewtopic.php?t=3946&sid=213e3cd998db98c4511675ecbba17af4<br/>I'm also testing JonDonym http://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/ (only the paid services support socks !) However, they do accept paysafecards which can currently be brought in exchange for Bitcoins.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1358 chars): When using proxy port 9050, it will only make one attempt to connect to IRC, then give up, since it knows it will probably always fail because IRC servers ban all the TOR exit nodes. If you're using another port, it would assume it might be a regular old normal proxy and would keep retrying IRC at longer and longer intervals. You should not use Polipo or Privoxy as those are http filters and caches that would corrupt Bitcoin's messages if they make any changes. Bitcoin might be trying to overcome it by reconnecting. You should use port 9050.<br/>As riX says, the "is giving Tor only an IP address. Apps that do DNS..." warnings are nothing to worry about. Bitcoin doesn't use DNS at all in proxy mode.<br/>Since Bitcoin can't get through to IRC through Tor, it doesn't know which nodes are currently online, so it has to try all the recently seen nodes. It tries to conserve connection attempts as much as possible, but also people want it to connect quickly when they start it up and reconnect quickly if disconnected. It uses an algorithm where it tries an IP less and less frequently the longer ago it was successful connected. For example, for a node it saw 24 hours ago, it would wait 5 hours between connection attempts. Once it has at least 2 connections, it won't try anything over a week old, and 5 connections it won't try anything over 24 hours old.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (77 chars): I think it was some technical limitation. Satoshi could tell more about this?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (670 chars): Yes, it's a technical limitation. Sending by bitcoin address enters the transaction into the network and the recipient discovers it from the network. You don't connect directly with them and they don't have to be online at the time.<br/>I very much wanted to find some way to include a short message, but the problem is, the whole world would be able to see the message. As much as you may keep reminding people that the message is completely non-private, it would be an accident waiting to happen.<br/>Unfortunately, ECDSA can only sign signatures, it can't encrypt messages, and we need the small size of ECDSA. RSA can encrypt messages, but it's many times bigger than ECDSA.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (846 chars): Why don't you make them send the email before the transaction? Then you could reply to that email with a new and unique bitcoin address. You don't even need to use email, it would be equally secure, although not that anonymous, to announce the customers email together with the bitcoin address on the frontpage of your site.<br/>The method you are using now is equal to someone sending you cash in an envelope anonymously, including a note with the time he posted it, after which you send goods back to the first person calling you stating the time and amount in the envelope. (Including the mailman and anyone who has access to you mailbox).<br/>Sending the email before the transaction is equal to someone calling you, getting a unique box address which to send the money to. When the money arrives to that post box, you send the goods to the customer.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1175 chars): The recommended ways to do a payment for an order:<br/>1) The merchant has a static IP, the customer sends to it with a comment.<br/>2) The merchant creates a new bitcoin address, gives it to the customer, the customer sends to that address. This will be the standard way for website software to do it.<br/>RSA vs ECDSA: it's not the size of the executable but the size of the data. I thought it would be impractical if the block chain, bitcoin addresses, disk space and bandwidth requirements were all an order of magnitude bigger. Also, even if using RSA for messages, it would still make sense to do all the bitcoin network with ECDSA and use RSA in parallel for only the message part. In that case, everything that's been implemented up to now would be implemented exactly as it has been.<br/>We can figure out the best way to do this much later. It could use a separate (maybe existing) e-mail or IM infrastructure to pass messages, and instead of RSA, maybe just put a hash of the message in the transaction to prove that the transaction is for the order described in the message. The message would have to include a salt so nobody could brute force the hash to reveal a short message.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (872 chars): Lately when I've been trying to send coins, the following popups twice, then the application terminates.<br/>EXCEPTION: St13runtime_error<br/>SendMoney() : wtxNew.AcceptTransaction() failed<br/>c:\Documents and Settingsameitcoin-0.2.0itcoin.exe in<br/>CMyApp::OnExceptionInMainLoop()<br/>When i restart bitcoin.exe, the transaction is showing as 0/unconfirmed. The status do not change even when the total block count increases.<br/>I'm running two instances of bitcoin in my home LAN, one at my desktop computer, and one in a virtual machine on my laptop, with the switch -connect=192.168.0.2 (ip of desktop computer).<br/>This occurs when I send to my own bitcoin address, to my other computers bitcoin address and to an other bitcoin address not currently active anywhere. I'm not sending by ip.<br/>I've been moving wallets and index-files back and forth, could this have something to do with this?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1098 chars): That is what happens if you copy wallet files around. If you copy your wallet file to a second computer, then they both think the money in the wallet is theirs. If one spends any of it, the other doesn't know those coins are already spent and would try to spend them again, and that's the error you would hit.<br/>Now that it's clear this is a key error message, it ought to be something more like "the money appears to be already spent... this could happen if you used a copy of your wallet file on another computer."<br/>You can move or backup your wallet file, but it needs to have only one "lineage" and only used in one place at a time. Any time you transfer money out of it, then you must no longer use any previous copies.<br/>This brings up a good point. In the case of restoring a backup that may be from before you spent some coins, we need to add functionality to resync it to discover which coins have already been spent. This would not be hard to do, it just hasn't been implemented yet. I'll add it to the list. This would make it mostly repair the situation instead of giving that error message.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (339 chars): Yes, I thought it had something to do with that.<br/>It would be nice if there was a wallet tool for merging wallet files, removing unused bitcoin addresses and as you say resyncing. (I tried to just re-download all the blocks, but as you know the transactions stayed anyway.)<br/>What about resyncing in the future when the Merkle-tree is pruned?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (812 chars): The resync idea would go through your wallet and check it against the block index to find any transactions that your current computer doesn't realize are already spent. That could happen if they were spent on another computer with a copy of the wallet file, or you had to restore the wallet to a backup from before they were spent. Currently, the software just assumes it always knows whether its transactions are spent because it marks them spent in wallet.dat when it spends them.<br/>A wallet merge tool is possible to implement but much less in demand once resync solves most of the problem. With resync, you could do about the same thing by sending all the money from one wallet to the other. The receiver would resync and discover all its overlapping coins were spent, then receive them in the new transaction.</p>

"Please send X bc to [single-use bitcoin address] to complete your order" When the server receives that amount to the bitcoin address, that could trigger it to automatically fulfil the order or e-mail the shop owner.<br/>Adding command line support is a high priority.

      <p><b>User</b> (243 chars): Can I just butt in with a question on why that is? To me it seems that if Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography to transfer ownership of the coins, it should be a trivial matter to include a short message that is only readable by the recipient.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (205 chars): Almost but not quite. Bitcoin uses EC-DSA, which can only do digital signing, not encryption. RSA can do both, but I didn't use it because it's an order of magnitude bigger and would have been impractical.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1037 chars): Not so ? I have had 2 machines connected (getting 4+ connections on each) and generating Bitcoins on the same static IP address. The port 8333 is of course forwarded for connection through my firewall, which I guess is what you mean. However, connections to other nodes are made without port 8333 being specifically forwarded through my router to a specific machine (sub-net IP), which is of course the best way to max connectivity. I understand Bitcoin only requires 1 other connection for transactions, yes ?<br/>I think my original question was valid and thanks for clarifying this everyone. NewLibertyStandard I think is correct "If I remember correctly I think I was told that they would be sent to the first bitcoin application with whom the sender connects."<br/>I dislike communication on forums, it's hard to discuss topics sometimes when all parties mean the same thing and communicate it in a different way !<br/>I have enough internet connections, routers and PC equipment - So, I'm off to make an 'official' test for myself whilst I RTM</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1034 chars): Port forwarding forwards a port to one computer. It tells the router which computer handles connections to that port. So that's the computer receiving.<br/>If you didn't set up port forwarding, then incoming connections won't go to any computer, and attempts to send to that IP would just say it couldn't connect to the recipient and nothing is sent. When sending by IP, you still send to a bitcoin address, but your computer connects to that IP, gets a new bitcoin address from it, gives the transaction directly to the them and confirms that it was received and accepted.<br/>Someone should post their static IP so people can try out sending by IP and also give that user free money.<br/>There's a 32-bit checksum in bitcoin addresses so you can't accidentally type an invalid address.<br/>If 4) you send to a recipient who has abandoned or lost their wallet.dat, then the money is lost. A subtle point can be made that since there is then less total money in circulation, everyone's remaining money is worth slightly more, aka "natural deflation".</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (233 chars): That's not possible. You've handed control of the money over to the recipient's keypair. Only that key can control it.<br/>It's similar to if you encrypt a file with AES and a strong password, and you lose the password. The data is lost.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1477 chars): I wanted to document an issue I encountered when first installing and using the Bitcoin software.<br/>Despite a correct installation and port forward settings I noticed that Bitcoin was not generating any coins or 'blocks' despite having 20+ connections for the first 24hrs. The block count just remained at 0. After realizing that Bitcoin was not 'catching up' with the collective network block download or generation I opened up the Task Manager to investigate the issue further.<br/>I noticed that the bitcoin.exe process seemed to be 'fighting' for CPU usage against MsMpEng.exe (Microsoft Security Essentials). I hadn't noticed any system slowdown due to having a fairly high spec. PC. After adding bitcoin.exe and the appropriate program folder locations to Exclude 'Files and Locations' and 'Exclude Processes' - Bitcoin instantly started generating blocks and the CPU processes returned to normal.<br/>I did not have any virus alerts or even 'false positive' identifications for Bitcoin. I know that the software is 100% OK. I'm assuming that the 'Live Protection' engine in Microsoft Security Essentials just doesn't 'play well' with some aspect of the CPU hungry cycles used in 'block' generation.<br/>I have yet to do more testing, however I also encountered the same issue when using Comodo Internet Security (free version).<br/>This is obviously going to be an issue for lots of new Bitcoin users who will perhaps be less 'tech savvy'. Has anyone else encountered any similar issues ?</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (328 chars): Satoshi, I figured it will take my modern core 2 duo about 20 hours of nonstop work to create ฿50.00! With older PCs it will take forever. People like to feel that they "own" something as soon as possible, is there a way to make the generation more divisible? So say, instead of making ฿50 every 20 hours, make ฿5 every 2 hours?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (545 chars): I thought about that but there wasn't a practical way to do smaller increments. The frequency of block generation is balanced between confirming transactions as fast as possible and the latency of the network.<br/>The algorithm aims for an average of 6 blocks per hour. If it was 5 bc and 60 per hour, there would be 10 times as many blocks and the initial block download would take 10 times as long. It wouldn't work anyway because that would be only 1 minute average between blocks, too close to the broadcast latency when the network gets larger.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (448 chars): Probably OK, but I'm not sure. The protocol is designed to resync to the next message, and messages get re-requested from all the other nodes you're connected to until received. If you miss a block, it'll also keep requesting it every time another blocks comes in and it sees there's a gap. Before the original release I did a test dropping 1 out of 4 random messages under heavy load until I could run it overnight without any nodes getting stuck.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (389 chars): My understanding is that every Bitcoin client has the same algorithm (formula) built into it to automatically adjust the difficulty every so many blocks.

      <p><b>User</b> (245 chars): If I'm reading the source code correctly, it should go up and down based on how much CPU is being thrown at it. So if someone rented a super computer to drive up the difficulty for a week, then it vanished, the difficulty should float back down.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (200 chars): It adjusted to 181.54 a few minutes ago. Typical time to get a block is about a week now.<br/>The difficulty can adjust down as well as up.<br/>The network should be generating close to 6 blocks per hour now.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (456 chars): Yeah, I've noticed the "10 second blocks" are gone, replaced with 419 and 741 second block generation with no more in the last 20 minutes. That should keep those server farms on hold for a while<br/>Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but now that block generation is taking a lot longer, doesn't that mean that the lucky person who got the block is going to take a lot longer to be verified by the network that he/she was the winner before they could ever spend it?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (164 chars): Yes, about 20 hours. (120 conf / 6 blocks per hour = 20 hours) That's the normal length of time before you can spend it. You know long before that that you won one.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (327 chars): I think that the overall network is generating the same amount of blocks regardless of the difficulty; the difficulty is intended so that the network generates a block in a relatively constant amount of time. Therefore, this confirmation time should always be around the same.<br/>Satoshi or anyone else can correct me if I'm wrong</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (424 chars): Right, the difficulty adjustment is trying to keep it so the network as a whole generates an average of 6 blocks per hour. The time for your block to mature will always be around 20 hours.<br/>The recent adjustment put us back to close to 6 blocks per hour again.<br/>There's a site where you can see the time between blocks, and since block 68545, it's been more like 10 minutes per block:<br/>http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (811 chars): Removing or extending the 21M limit would be a disaster, it's the finite supply of this digital cash that makes it useful as money.<br/>Allowing for the currency to be further divided would solve that issue. No one loses the value of any of their currency held(devaluation or debasing), while at the same time being able to break off smaller pieces of a ฿ to trade.<br/>Besides, the whole point is that there is no (central)control over the supply, this would allow it to be extinguished by governments or abused by a central authority (like today's central banks & governments)<br/>I am wondering Satoshi, what would be the technical difficulty of implementing ฿ as 0.000(or more zeroes) instead of 0.00?<br/>This is not a request since there is no need for it yet, but may wish to acommadate a larger user base in the future.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (645 chars): Eventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it really gets huge.<br/>But don't worry, there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for a total of 8 decimal places internally. It shows 1.00 but internally it's 1.00000000. If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could show more decimal places.<br/>If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point. Same amount of money, just different convention for where the ","'s and "."'s go. e.g. moving the decimal place 3 places would mean if you had 1.00000 before, now it shows it as 1,000.00.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (578 chars): No, sorry. I've been meaning to redo it. The largest icon that still looks good is the 20x20 one which is used for the tray icon in GNOME. Any larger than that looks bad. The 16x16 and 20x20 ones have quite a bit of hand tweaking to get the pixels to work out right. If you just scale down a larger image, the pixels end up blurred and awkward in places where the lines in "BC" don't land square on a pixel.<br/>The best 16x16 with full alpha channel is in src/rc/bitcoin.ico. I don't like the 32x32 version.<br/>I'm attaching bitcoin20x20.png, the 20x20 version with full transparency.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1045 chars): First request:<br/>Optional connect to IP dialog.<br/>BitCoin connects to the network(of peers) by getting one of a number of IP's from IRC at present, once connected to a single peer other connections can be made, so if only 1 IP on the list are available then you can connect to the network & make connections to other IP's(this is my assumption, please correct me if I am wrong).<br/>This is somewhat similar to how Tor works, when you first start it up it attempts to connect to a public list of IP's(public bridge nodes). This list being public is accessible to organisations that want to prevent the use of Tor(for example the Chinese or Iranian government). And so as a consequence these IP's are blocked, and you cannot connect from these countries.<br/>However there is the option to connect to the ip of a bridge (if you know one, a friend in a free country running Tor in bridge mode perhaps) and so this circumvents regime blocking attempts and is very robust.<br/>Adding this feature will allow Bitcoin to function despite regime efforts to prevent it.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (701 chars): There are command line options:<br/>bitcoin -addnode=1.2.3.4 to tell bitcoin about a node to connect to<br/>bitcoin -connect=1.2.3.4 connect only to the specified node(s)<br/>You can use more than one of these, for instance<br/>bitcoin -connect=(first to try) -connect=(next to try) ...<br/>You can specify non-routable IPs with -connect like 192.168.x.x, so if you had a server farm and you wanted one server to connect to the world and the rest to connect to the one server, you could do that.<br/>In particular, -addnode is needed if you're always going to connect through TOR, since the IRC server blocks all the TOR exit nodes. To connect through TOR, you could use:<br/>bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=212.159.72.216</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1240 chars): I updated the SVN with changes to support translation.

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (408 chars): There's a small transaction fee for very large transactions.

If all you have is generated coins in your wallet, if you send them all in one huge transaction, it has to bundle hundreds of 50 bc coins together. After that it's just one line to send the combined unit.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (95 chars): why do we even need fees ? i thougt the no-fees-feature was one of the advantages of bitcoin ?!</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (721 chars): Almost all transactions are free. A transaction is over the maximum size limit if it has to add up more than 500 of the largest payments you've received to make up the amount. A transaction over the size limit can still be sent if a small fee is added.<br/>The average transaction, and anything up to 500 times bigger than average, is free.<br/>It's only when you're sending a really huge transaction that the transaction fee ever comes into play, and even then it only works out to something like 0.002% of the amount. It's not money sucked out of the system, it just goes to other nodes. If you're sad about paying the fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (124 chars): Is the fee enough to always ensure the profitability of running a node, even when BitCoin generation stops being profitable?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (348 chars): Right. Otherwise we couldn't have a finite limit of 21 million coins, because there would always need to be some minimum reward for generating. In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes. I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (399 chars): Hello,<br/>well the title says it all. I want to set up multiple bitcoin machines behind NAT.<br/>For this it reason would be nice, if one could choose an other port than 8333, which I guess would have other nice side effects. Maybe someone uses this port for something else or maybe it isn't possible to set up port forwarding to this port for one reason or another.<br/>Or is there an other way one should go?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (924 chars): Right now there isn't a port number setting to do that. It's a feature yet to be implemented. You can only set up your NAT to port-forward to one of the computers. (I said something earlier about NAT port translation, but that wouldn't work, other nodes wouldn't know to connect to that port)<br/>If you want, as a small optimization, you could run the rest of your computers as:<br/>bitcoin -connect=&lt;the IP of the first computer&gt;<br/>so they get all their network communication from the first computer and don't all connect over the net individually for the same information. This saves bandwidth, although it doesn't use much bandwidth to begin with, so it wouldn't really matter unless you had tons of computers.<br/>For redundancy in case the first computer goes down, you could have two that connect out and the rest connect to both of them. The first two are run normally, the rest are run like:<br/>bitcoin -connect=&lt;IP1&gt; -connect=&lt;IP2&gt;</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (216 chars): So, if I somehow I forwarded port router:8333 to bitcoinhost1:8333 and router:8334 to bitcoinhost2:8333, we get undefined behavior?<br/>Because that seems like trivial to me, to keep track of port numbers in any p2p app.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (565 chars): At the moment, it always assumes the incoming port is 8333, so it would tell other bitcoin nodes to connect to router:8333 even if you're redirecting from another port number.<br/>I'm not in a big hurry to fix this because I can't think of any benefit to having more than one incoming connection port. If you're providing one incoming port, then you've done your bit to help the network. Having two incoming ports to the same person doesn't help redundancy.<br/>If you have many computers, then using the -connect switch on most of them to connect locally makes more sense.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (951 chars): I think we can do that.<br/>Although it would be possible for Bitcoin to take care of business in the HTTP response by presenting HTML UI to the user, as a user I would wonder if some website is trying to trick me or if I'm really talking to my own Bitcoin server.<br/>The HTTP response could simply be HTML with the JavaScript equivalent of the back button, sending it back to the page. Bitcoin then pops up the Send Bitcoins dialog with the destination bitcoin address and amount already filled in. It would work just like a mailto: link that pops up a new email with the address filled in.<br/>127.0.0.1 loopback is accessible by any user on the machine, it doesn't have per-user separation, but it's OK because it would only serve the convenience function of pre-filling the fields in a dialog. You'd still have to press Send. We'd have to make sure the Send button is not selected so it couldn't jump into the foreground while you're typing a space or enter.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (2691 chars): Nothing to sweat people. Nobody ever died of a 'deflationary spiral.' I agree with "I-am-not-anonymous." The market will choose the best bitcoin-like currency. I happen to believe, however, that the rules that Satoshi has founded bitcoin on will be more than adequate for the future of a thriving bitcoin economy.<br/>Everybody knows exactly how fast the supply of bitcoins will grow: it's set in stone in the rules of the programming and the bitcoin network. While it's true that there is not a currently existing fully-fleshed out market to truly price bitcoins, such markets and exchanges are being developed. As far as future would-be bitcoin generators are concerned, the question is not how much will he "demand....to compensate for his costs." The question he'll be asking himself is "given current market values and my ability to utilize electricity and CPU resources, is it worth it for me to generate bitcoins?" If the answer is yes, he participates. If it's no, he stops trying to mine for bitcoins and focuses on trading tangible assets with bitcoins serving as an appropriate intermediary. If he's not sure, he tries his hand at it for a while and then makes a final decision.<br/>The number of nodes and associated computational cpu power will be in flux, and that competitive flux will allow for costs to approximate value (not the other way around.) Value being set by the markets and the demand for use of bitcoin as a trade intermediary (a money). In the far future, the competition of transaction costs will play a more important role for the would-be node operator.<br/>Contrary to the paradox of thrift argument you present, collecting bitcoins and saving them with hopes of earning purchasing power through deflation is not a bad thing. It will allow for the pooling of bitcoin capital and make purchases of larger capital investments possible. In the future, there might even be bitcoin banks that lend out saved bitcoins with market-set interest rates, thereby diminishing the effects of hoarding. All this wonderful saving, however, comes at a price: delayed gratification of present desires. From the perspective of the would-be saver, the question will always be denying present desires to purchase real tangible assets now versus the future possibilities of purchasing more later. This time preference naturally varies with people and in different circumstances.<br/>Given the fact that bitcoins are by their electronic nature easily divisible, prices will be able to easily adjust to deflationary pressures. If too many are saving, prices will fall and the rate of interest will go down. This encourages demand (lower prices) and decreases the desire to save (less interest).<br/>XC</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1073 chars): Excellent analysis, xc.<br/>A rational market price for something that is expected to increase in value will already reflect the present value of the expected future increases. In your head, you do a probability estimate balancing the odds that it keeps increasing.<br/>In the absence of a market to establish the price, NewLibertyStandard's estimate based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service (thanks). The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, then production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more. At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.<br/>In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around.<br/>At the moment, generation effort is rapidly increasing, suggesting people are estimating the present value to be higher than the current cost of production.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (182 chars): Is there some hard-coded maximum limit for the amount of connections? I see 45 connections atm. It's been growing nicely in the last months. Just can't get that many coins anymore...</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (867 chars): Nodes stop trying to initiate connections once they have 15. If you can accept incoming connections, then you can get well above that from nodes connecting to you, otherwise you max out at 15.<br/>I don't know if there's any reason to have 15 connections. Maybe it should be 10.<br/>Since nodes that can only connect out are probably at or near 15 most of the time now, you should level off to an equilibrium. 45 suggests a ratio of 3 out-only nodes to every 1 in-accepting node.<br/>The number of connections won't be a good gauge of the size of the network any more. Someone should periodically IRC to the bitcoin channel on chat.freenode.net and count the number of users. That gives you the total count of network nodes (except TOR nodes).<br/>Block generation is again running ahead of pace. We're in for another big step up in difficulty at the next adjustment in about 5 days.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (595 chars): Just a random streak of bad luck. It looks steady to me.<br/>Competition doesn't have an effect until the next automatic retarget adjustment, and we haven't reached the next one yet.<br/>The adjustments are every 2016 blocks. To calculate our progress towards the next one, divide the block total by 2016. The fractional part is how far we are to the next one.<br/>My back-of-the-envelope projection: 42032 blocks/2016 = 20.85 = 85% of the way. About 1.5 days to go until the next one. That'll only be about 10 days since the last one, the target is 14 days, so 14/10 = 1.4 = around 40% difficulty increase.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (470 chars): Excellent. This would be a good resource for those participating in the banner contest. Why unequal dimensions?<br/>My only suggestion would be to make the coin's text stand out more. At tiny resolutions outlines tend to be come unworkable, so a better option may be to experiment with contrast. Making the text significantly darker than the rest of the coin would likely increase readability. Alternately, you could make the inner circle color darker, and the text lighter.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (752 chars): Good suggestion. I made the B slightly lighter and the background slightly darker. Very slightly. The foreground is now exactly the same colour as the BC in the old one.<br/>It's kind of OK if you can't easily read the B in the 16x16. At that size, you just need to see that it's a coin. It doesn't matter so much what's embossed on it, just that there be some detail there because it wouldn't look like a coin if it was a blank smooth circle.<br/>It's slightly wider than tall because the dark perspective under it goes more to the right than down.<br/>I finished and posted the 32x31 and 48x47 versions in the first message. I like the 48 a lot.<br/>How does everyone feel about the B symbol with the two lines through the outside? Can we live with that as our logo?</p>

I'll give the original when I'm finished.<br/>I had to custom tweak each icon size so the vertical lines land square on their pixels, otherwise they're ugly blurry and inconsistent.

Newlibertstandard uses paypal, which already practices know-your-customer and he is operating in amounts less than $10,000 which is what the money laundering and tax cheat police sniff out for. This means he is unlikely to be doing anything that is wrong OR anything that will attract the attention of Law Enforcement.<br/>However---<br/>Thinking ahead to bitcoin's future--money changing services that operate on a large scale and don't practice know-your customer would indeed be illegal and would thus have to operate within the onionverse, changing bitcoin to money services other than paypal (perhaps offshore based like pecunix).<br/>Another idea would be for some future crypto-preneur to set up a Mom and Pop shop called "Grandpa Joe's envelopes stuffed with cash" and only accept bitcoin as payment. lol.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (598 chars): When there's enough scale, maybe there can be an exchange site that doesn't do transfers, just matches up buyers and sellers to exchange with each other directly, similar to how e-bay works.<br/>To make it safer, the exchange site could act as an escrow for the bitcoin side of the payment. The seller puts the bitcoin payment in escrow, and the buyer sends the conventional payment directly to the seller. The exchange service doesn't handle any real world money.<br/>This would be a step better than e-bay. E-bay manages to work fine even though shipped goods can't be recovered if payment falls through.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (620 chars): That's a great idea. There's a thriving business in those services, but I've always thought the standard payment methods are at odds with privacy minded customers.<br/>Would you consider making your software freely available so anyone could easily set one up? I know for competitive reasons the inclination is to keep it to yourself, but it could get an order of magnitude more use if anyone could give proxy access to their country just by putting the software on a server.<br/>I wonder if there are other kinds of web application servers where we would only have to tack on the payment mechanism to an already existing system?</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (777 chars): I think the way eMule handles bootstrapping for its KAD-network is pretty close to optimal:<br/>The list of known peers is stored in a file (nodes.dat), and every client maintains a list of known nodes in that file (sorted by longest uptime, I think -- that's an intrinsic property of Kademlia, but still a good idea). The released client should be accompanied by such a file that contains the addresses of a few reliable peers on static IP addresses, from which a new client can then get more addresses to connect to (and hence store in its own file).<br/>If the "seed list" gets out of date, or the server is shut down or something, you can just ask *anyone* in the network to publish his nodes-file (on rapidshare, say), and voila, you've got a fresh list of IPs you can connect to.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (501 chars): The SVN version now uses IRC first and if that fails it falls back to a hardcoded list of seed nodes. There are enough seed nodes now that many of them should still be up by the time of the next release. It only briefly connects to a seed node to get the address list and then disconnects, so your connections drop back to zero for while. At that point, be patient. It's only slow to get connected the first time.<br/>This means TOR users won't need to -addnode anymore, it'll get connected automatically.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (826 chars): LR and Pecunix have many established exchanges to paper currencies by various payment methods, and a number of vendors accept them as payment, so an exchange link between Bitcoin and LR/Pecunix would give us 2nd-hop access to all that. The possibility to cash out through them would help support the value of bitcoins.<br/>Bitcoin has unique properties that would be complementary. LR/Pecunix are easy to spend anonymously, but hard to buy anonymously and not worth the trouble to buy in small amounts. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is easy to get in small amounts anonymously. It would be convenient to buy LR/Pecunix with bitcoins rather than through conventional payment methods.<br/>Most customers who convert to LR to buy something would probably ask the seller first if they accept Bitcoin, encouraging them to start accepting it.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (802 chars): Really from a purist stance, people should audit the code and build it themselves.<br/>However this would exclude most people except dorks like us.. so you just have to trust that you got it from a reputable source. I distribute a Mac OS X binary version but if you don't trust me you shouldn't be using it. Similarly, I can make a password manager tool or a PayPal assistant tool and I can make it send your passwords and money to me. You have to trust someone I guess unless you are willing to audit the code yourself. The network itself has some protections from non-cooperative nodes but the users are obviously targets for scamming. Kind of reminds me of the card skimmers people install on ATMs too.. they think they're using a trustworthy machine but it's been modified to capture their information.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1888 chars): It's not the download so much as verifying all the signatures in all the blocks as it downloads that takes a long time.<br/>How long is the initial block download typically taking? Does it slow down half way through or is about the same speed the whole way?<br/>I've thought about ways to do a more cursory check of most of the chain up to the last few thousand blocks. It is possible, but it's a lot of work, and there are a lot of other higher priority things to work on.<br/>Simplified Payment Verification is for lightweight client-only users who only do transactions and don't generate and don't participate in the node network. They wouldn't need to download blocks, just the hash chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than a second to verify the whole chain). If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we'll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes. At that stage, most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated.<br/>SPV is not implemented yet, and won't be implemented until far in the future, but all the current implementation is designed around supporting it.<br/>In the meantime, sites like vekja.net and www.mybitcoin.com have been experimenting with account-based sites. You create an account on a website and hold your bitcoins on account there and transfer in and out. Creating an account on a website is a lot easier than installing and learning to use software, and a more familiar way of doing it for most people. The only disadvantage is that you have to trust the site, but that's fine for pocket change amounts for micropayments and misc expenses. It's an easy way to get started and if you get larger amounts then you can upgrade to the actual bitcoin software.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (313 chars): If you're generating a new Bitcoin Address for each transaction, people may accidentally send to old ones. They will have that BA in their Transaction history and may think it's good for multiple uses. Just something to think about.<br/>The possibility of accidentally sending to a random BA is insanely small though.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (283 chars): When you generate a new bitcoin address, it only takes disk space on your own computer (like 500 bytes). It's like generating a new PGP private key, but less CPU intensive because it's ECC. The address space is effectively unlimited. It doesn't hurt anyone, so generate all you want.</p>

(now it's renamed to listreceivedbyaddress 0) The default is 1 confirmation, but I think in reality most digital goods and services can be 0 confirmations. Like you say, if you need more than 0 confirmations, you could show two numbers, unconfirmed and available balance, so they immediately see their transaction went through.<br/>listreceivedbyaddress [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]<br/>[minconf] is the minimum number of confirmations before payments are included.<br/>[includeempty] whether to include addresses that haven't received any payments.<br/>Returns an array of objects containing:<br/>"address" : receiving address<br/>"label" : the label of the receiving address<br/>"amount" : total amount received by the address<br/>"confirmations" : number of confirmations of the most recent transaction included<br/>or listreceivedbylabel if you're labelling addresses with their username.<br/>So far I've concentrated on functions for web merchants, not so much on stuff for remote management of headless coin generators yet.</p>

It doesn't seem to have any problems creating or removing icons, but I'm using XFCE, so that might be the difference.<br/>In addition, there's a difference between standard behaviour for tray icons in Windows and Linux. In most Linux apps, clicking the tray button while the app's window is open will cause it to close again.

      <p><b>User</b> (553 chars): 4. About the .po file :<br/>- There are a few strings in the .po file that don't needs translation (ie: "Bitcoin"). Maybe those shouldn't be inside _("...") ?<br/>- Others shouldn't be split. I can remember one message about transaction fee where the string is split in two to insert the fee value, where you could simply have put a %s. It makes the message harder to translate as I had to go in the source to find exactly what was going on.<br/>- Some strings have whitespace at the end or start, which necessity is very debatable, and it's easy to miss in PoEdit.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (293 chars): Many of the strings are in code automatically generated from uiproject.fbp where nothing can be done about these things.

I guess it's not for the program and for translators because when one use poedit he can always check what the particular string belongs to. By the way, there are some similar lines that possibly may be replaced by one. They are very close by meaning and differs only by 1-2 words. Just a suggestion of course.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (412 chars): The order matters not to the program, but it matters to me maintaining it. If it jumbles the order of the .po file then I can't diff for changes.

      <p><b>User</b> (1850 chars): Although I'm not familiar with the specifics of the algorithm implementation in C++, I am familiar with how the verification works in general. Although the algorithm would have to be re-written, it really should be possible to verify blocks in both directions at the same time. Each block contains the hash of the previous block, but the first block contains a genesis hash, which isn't the hash of a previous block. The first time bitcoins starts, it would treat a recent hash, perhaps a one day old hash as a temporary genesis hash and quickly verify the roughly 144 blocks up to the most recent block and it would continue to verify and optionally generate new hashes. Another thread would grab a previous hash, perhaps a two day old hash and treat it as the new temporary genesis hash. It would quickly verify the roughly 144 blocks, and verify that the last hash matches the previous genesis hash. The second thread would continue verifying previous blocks until it reached the real genesis block, which I believe is defined within Bitcoin itself. As you can see, blocks are always being verified in forward direction, but the beginning point is just pushed back until it reaches the real beginning. There could even be a third thread which would start at the real genesis hash and verify blocks from there so that they meet in the middle. All three of those threads could be grouped into another thread which would be run for each different chain of blocks which it is told about from other Bitcoin peers. If more than one chain is verified as authentic, Bitcoin would calculate and compare the total amount of computing power required to create the chain and keep only the strongest chain. Off the top of my head, an easy way to calculate the strongest chain, would be to find the largest sum of the inverses of the numeric value of each hash.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (541 chars): It does in fact download 500 blocks at a time, then the counter counts one at a time as it verifies the blocks.<br/>The advantage of letting bitcoin download and verify the blocks is that you do not have to trust the person you're downloading them from. If you downloaded the blk*.dat files from some site, you would have to trust that site, since you would be accepting the data without verifying it yourself. If you're copying blk*.dat from another computer of yours, that should be fine.<br/>How long is the initial block download taking for you?</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1875 chars): I'm not sure what you mean by again (I'm not the developer).. anyway I'm just trying to explain why I don't think you should use it to accept payments. Sending payments to a hostname is not reliable for the reasons I said above, and the biggest problem is that there is no way to even know that the payment went to the wrong place, for the sender. There is a better (reliable) alternative using one time bitcoin addresses.<br/>What I was getting at is that there is no authentication and no way to know if the payment got there with internet address based transactions. I think the internet address based payments are only for testing locally. The option is there but I don't think it's suitable for using on the internet or any multi-user network.<br/>If there was any real amount of internet address based transactions and tor users I would set up an exit node just to intercept any tor based payments.. I still may do it just to see if I can get any because it's just another way to make a few more bitcoins per day.<br/>I guess what I'm trying to say that it is the equivalent of leaving a pile of cash in your driveway with a rock on top of it to keep it from blowing away in the wind. Anyone can just go pick it up and so if you're a service provider you would not want to encourage your customers to pay you in that way, because it would just cause problems when the customer says they paid and the service provider says they didn't receive it. The only reason it's even possible to use on the internet right now is because unlike cash which has perceived value to a lot of people, bitcoins are like a pile of rocks to random internet users, they just walk by. If there are all these piles of bitcoins in everybody's driveway and people start figuring out that they're valuable, you can bet they'll start disappearing, so it's best not to put them there in the first place.<br/>Laszlo</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1071 chars): The current sending by IP is not very useful: it connects to the IP, so you'd like to use TOR for anonymity, but then it can totally be eavesdropped and man-in-the-middled.<br/>The future plan for sending to an IP is to make it a bitcoin address plus IP, like:<br/>1auaDZCFYqaGx4FKS5WenNfurk2SkoDu4h&lt;someseparatorcharacter&gt;1.2.3.4<br/>or<br/>1auaDZCFYqaGx4FKS5WenNfurk2SkoDu4h&lt;someseparatorcharacter&gt;domain.com<br/>I need suggestions for the separator character. ":" is a candidate, but IPv6 has : in it and that might get confusing. Something that's allowed in url parameters would be nice.<br/>I want to use SSL for the connection, using the bitcoin address' public key as the cert. You would be certain you're connected to who you thought, and safely encrypted. The bitcoin address would not be used for the transaction, only for authentication. A new generated bitcoin address would be sent through the SSL connection.<br/>Since it's authenticated, it would then be safe to allow the IP address to be a domain name. Some care taken that if a proxy is used, it uses socks4a instead of DNS lookup.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (844 chars): That would be perfect, although I would prefer to use the hostname on the right side.<br/>Of course, I'm the kind of guy who might shop at thenerdsshop.com<br/>For grandma, the entire bitcoin concept is pretty confusing at the moment. Even neglecting all the technical details, the UI still shows a huge string of numbers and letters (your receiving address) and best practices currently require you to deal with that every time you give someone your address.<br/>Another option is to use something like what OpenID uses: hidden tags on the store's (hopefully SSL) site. Then you could just enter a site's URL as the receiving address. It would hit that site, search for something like<br/>&lt;link rel="bitcoin.address" href="19vcWM6EEbQHVdN2W8NXv9ySgsPjbZ6gU3"&gt;<br/>&lt;link rel="bitcoin.server" href="12.34.56.78"&gt;<br/>Or some other form and try to send securely to that.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1631 chars): SirArthur has a good point about the normal online merchant case, which is what the send-by-IP option is more suited to. This is the case where the merchant will have a server on a static IP and their own domain name and SSL cert.<br/>Instead of connecting by IP, we can connect to a domain name by SSL, using the existing CA infrastructure to authenticate that you're connected to the owner of that domain.<br/>The user would send to domain.com (or www.domain.com is ok too). That would be very natural and users could see and verify that what they entered is who they intend to pay.<br/>The SSL also makes it safe for TOR users.<br/>Problem is, I think merchants would still prefer to use bitcoin addresses to be certain they know what the payment is for. You simply cannot count on users to enter the right thing in the comment fields to identify the transaction. It would only approach practical if we had a mailto style link that prepopulates the comment field with the order number, but then the link could just as well be a bitcoin address.<br/>Just having an open bitcoin server at domain.com that users could send unidentified payments to would be too much of a liability. Regular users aren't used to the idea of having to identify the payment. Merchants would get too many blank payments followed by "I paid you, where's my stuff?!" a week later.<br/>The payment sequence does have a step where the receiver verifies the order before accepting it. It can reject the payment and return an error message if it doesn't contain a valid order number. That would require a difficult level of integration of custom code with the bitcoin server though.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (86 chars): Adding transactions to the block you're working on will slow down your generation rate</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (677 chars): The premise is false. Adding more transactions to the block you're working on does NOT slow down your generation rate. When generate is scanning hashes, it only hashes the header of the block, which is constant size. The header contains a hash of the transactions (the Merkle root) and is only updated occasionally.<br/>If necessary I can write code to make nodes prefer not to use a block if it doesn't contain enough of the transactions they know about. A discouraged block would almost always fail to be included in the main chain, but would be accepted if it did get in. I doubt this will be necessary, since there's no real advantage for nodes not to include all transactions.</p>

If there was an app, it could be a front end to one of those, with the main feature being QR-code reader, or maybe there's already a universal QR-code reading app that web sites can be designed to accept scans from.<br/>If there was an iPhone app that was just a front end for vekja or mybitcoin, not a big involved P2P, would apple approve it and if not, on what basis? It could always be an Android app instead. An app is not really necessary though, just a mobile sized website.<br/>A web interface to your own Bitcoin server at home wouldn't be a solution for everyone.

      <p><b>User</b> (349 chars): So it's possible to switch "on the fly" to a new hash function? Wouldn't all the old transactions then be compromised (because they could be trivially recomputed)?<br/>SHA-256 has already been weakened by a factor of 16 (according to my friend. I can't find documentation on that, but I trust him). That's 16 out of 2^256, so not a huge deal, but still.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (712 chars): SHA-256 is very strong. It's not like the incremental step from MD5 to SHA1. It can last several decades unless there's some massive breakthrough attack.<br/>If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.<br/>If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could transition to a new hash in an orderly way. The software would be programmed to start using a new hash after a certain block number. Everyone would have to upgrade by that time. The software could save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure a different block with the same old hash can't be used.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1244 chars): So I'm writing a little tool that dissects the Bitcoin wallet.dat, mainly because I want to understand better exactly how Bitcoin works.<br/>And I see that the outputs of transactions have a value (number of bitcoins) and a bunch of bytes that are run through the little Forth-like scripting language built in to bitcoin. E.g.:<br/>['TxOut: value: 100.00 Script: DUP HASH160 6fad...ab90 EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG']<br/>First: it make me a little nervous that bitcoin has a scripting language in it, even though it is a really simple scripting language (no loops, no pointers, nothing but math and crypto). It makes me nervous because it is more complicated, and complication is the enemy of security. It also makes it harder to create a second, compatible implementation. But I think I can get over that.<br/>Looking at the code, new transactions are verified by pushing the signature an then public key on the interpreter's stack and then running the TxOut script (did I get that right?).<br/>Could I write code to create transactions with any valid script in the TxOut?<br/>E.g. could I create a TxOut with a script of: OP_2DROP OP_TRUE<br/>... to create a coin that could be spent by anybody?<br/>And is flexibility in the types of coins created the reason it is coded this way?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (2027 chars): The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime. Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of. The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time. It would have been an explosion of special cases. The solution was script, which generalizes the problem so transacting parties can describe their transaction as a predicate that the node network evaluates. The nodes only need to understand the transaction to the extent of evaluating whether the sender's conditions are met.<br/>The script is actually a predicate. It's just an equation that evaluates to true or false. Predicate is a long and unfamiliar word so I called it script.<br/>The receiver of a payment does a template match on the script. Currently, receivers only accept two templates: direct payment and bitcoin address. Future versions can add templates for more transaction types and nodes running that version or higher will be able to receive them. All versions of nodes in the network can verify and process any new transactions into blocks, even though they may not know how to read them.<br/>The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago. Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc. If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.<br/>I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network. The MIT license is compatible with all other licenses and commercial uses, so there is no need to rewrite it from a licensing standpoint.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (850 chars): A second version would be a massive development and maintenance hassle for me. It's hard enough maintaining backward compatibility while upgrading the network without a second version locking things in. If the second version screwed up, the user experience would reflect badly on both, although it would at least reinforce to users the importance of staying with the official version. If someone was getting ready to fork a second version, I would have to air a lot of disclaimers about the risks of using a minority version. This is a design where the majority version wins if there's any disagreement, and that can be pretty ugly for the minority version and I'd rather not go into it, and I don't have to as long as there's only one version.<br/>I know, most developers don't like their software forked, but I have real technical reasons in this case.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (407 chars): I wonder though, is there a point where the difficulty of generating a new coinbase is so high that it would make more sense to try to recover keys for lost coins or steal other people's coins instead? The difficulty of that is really high so for now it makes a lot more sense to generate but I just wonder what the real figures are.. would that ever become more productive? Maybe Satoshi can address this..</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (178 chars): Computers have to get about 2^200 times faster before that starts to be a problem. Someone with lots of compute power could make more money by generating than by trying to steal.</p>

I can't imagine how 8% more could be squeezed out of it. Is it possible Windows could have 8% more overhead?

(The day they make it illegal, you should open a bottle of champagne, because that's the sign that bitcoin is a success.)<br/>So at that point, they will also shut down your registry. And all the people who gave their address to that agency will get into trouble.<br/>If there is a major flaw discovered in Bitcoin and there is no sufficient time to swap to a different system, I assume there is nothing you can do about a loss of your wealth.<br/>Still, let's suppose YOU have discovered a way to produce an unlimited amount of coins. Your goal would be to profit from that secret AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. So even people that have the power to cheat wouldn't want a collapse of the digital fiat currency. And before the collapse of the old currency they would change their fake money for a better currency. But I am afraid that also goes for the so called "real" money. But.. somebody who has the brains to fool the algorithm of the digital currency at least gets a reward for his genius. In our paper fiat money system in the contrary, people who have access to the "printing press" of the government / central bank get rewarded for being just plain assholes.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (810 chars): Thanks for the feedback on this.<br/>One thing we could do is lower the outbound connections from 15 to 10 or maybe even 5. The choice of 15 was arbitrary. It just needs to be enough for redundancy and fast exponential propagation of messages. 10 would still be plenty. 5 should be fine. 10 is good as a nice round number so users can see that it stopped intentionally.<br/>It would help to implement UPnP so there would be more inbound accepting nodes. Your number of connections is the ratio of inbound accepting nodes to out-only times 15. We need to encourage more people to accept inbound connections.<br/>I will implement a feature to stop accepting inbound connections once you hit a certain number.<br/>Which version are you running?<br/>Anyone know how many connections typical P2P software like BitTorrent can get up to?</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (736 chars): BitTorrent clients can do hundreds of connections easily - this is why they end up killing those little embedded routers. It should be no problem for a regular IP router but the little embedded things are doing NAT so they're tracking state on all those connections and run out of memory.. also they're very slow SoC style computers so everything going through them suffers.<br/>Torrent clients generally have options for configuring a global maximum number of connections, maximum inbound and maximum outbound connections.<br/>I think it would be good to allow configuration of unlimited inbound/outbound connections for those who have the capability to do it, and provide a conservative default for those who are using NAT, tor, proxies, etc.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (339 chars): I reduced max outbound connections from 15 to 8 in RC4.<br/>15 was way more than we needed for redundancy. 8 is still plenty of redundancy.<br/>As the nodes upgrade to this version, this will cut in half the number of connections that inbound accepting nodes get.<br/>If anyone wants more than 8 connections, they can open port 8333 on their firewall.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (922 chars): Good revisions so far.<br/>More suggestions:<br/>1) How about mentioning bittorrent instead of hashcash? Bittorrent is a huge buzz word and could grab some attention. As a completely distributed and anonymous network, I'd say that Bitcoin is similar enough to justify the comparison.<br/>2) "...clients burn CPU cycles..." --&gt; "...nodes burn CPU cycles..."<br/>3) Throw in "decentralized" and "proof-of-work based" somewhere<br/>4) Personally, I'm still not fully satisfied with the mention of energy-backing. Maybe you could replace it with something about the time-stamped transaction history being voted on / secured by the majority of CPU power?<br/>5) Not to be a smartass, but watch out for passive voice (e.g. "It is expected that over time..."). Headlines and news articles usually try to grab readers' attention by using the more exciting active voice.<br/>Feel free to take all, none, or somewhere in between.

(I've been meaning to edit the homepage)<br/>"The developers expect that this will result in a stable-with-respect-to-energy currency outside the reach of any government." -- I am definitely not making an such taunt or assertion.<br/>It's not stable-with-respect-to-energy. There was a discussion on this. It's not tied to the cost of energy. NLS's estimate based on energy was a good estimated starting point, but market forces will increasingly dominate.<br/>Sorry to be a wet blanket. Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There's nothing to relate it to.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (323 chars): I second this, however I don't think block generation time should be changed. I think it should be identical to the production network. This, for example, would allow testers to try to subvert the system by creating nodes with particularly low latency, and keep the results applicable to the real network.<br/>Great idea Gavin!</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (818 chars): I'll start thinking about how to do this.<br/>At the moment, you can kind of use -connect. You can use -connect to make it connect to local computers on your LAN, like -connect=192.168.0.100. If you start it out blank and don't let it connect to the main network, the difficulty is still at the original low difficulty. If you've port-forwarded though, then outside nodes might still connect inward to you.<br/>With -connect it still uses IRC, do you think it shouldn't get on IRC when you're telling it to only connect to specific nodes with -connect? The main scenario for -connect is where you have a server farm, with two connected to the network and the rest connected to the first two. In that case, you wouldn't want the -connect computers on IRC.<br/>void ThreadIRCSeed(void* parg)<br/>{<br/>if (mapArgs.count("-connect"))<br/>return;</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (517 chars): Not bad.<br/>As far as anonymous internet connections go, prepaid phones aren't a bad choice either. They're cheap, nearly impossible to tie to the user, and can be destroyed when finished. Again, they can be bought in densely crowded shopping malls or walmarts.<br/>Dont forget to use an anonymous method to pay for the VPS foreverdamaged. Perhaps a prepaid credit card also bought from a crowded location would do the trick.<br/>By the way, I like to imagine that this user is in China and is trying to buy a book about freedom</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1440 chars): It's hard to imagine the Internet getting segmented airtight. It would have to be a country deliberately and totally cutting itself off from the rest of the world.<br/>Any node with access to both sides would automatically flow the block chain over, such as someone getting around the blockade with a dial-up modem or sat-phone. It would only take one node to do it. Anyone who wants to keep doing business would be motivated.<br/>If the network is segmented and then recombines, any transactions in the shorter fork that were not also in the longer fork are released into the transaction pool again and are eligible to get into future blocks. Their number of confirmations would start over.<br/>If anyone took advantage of the segmentation to double-spend, such that there are different spends of the same money on each side, then the double-spends in the shorter fork lose out and go to 0/unconfirmed and stay that way.<br/>It wouldn't be easy to take advantage of the segmentation to double-spend. If it's impossible to communicate from one side to the other, how are you going to put a spend on each side? If there is a way, then probably someone else is also using it to flow the block chain over.<br/>You would usually know whether you're in the smaller segment. For example, if your country cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the rest of the world is the larger segment. If you're in the smaller segment, you should assume nothing is confirmed.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (573 chars): It is unnecessary to protect against an attack in which an attacker buys all Bitcoins and deletes their wallet.<br/>Assuming we were all willing to sell, the attacker would just give us large amounts of cash for our Bitcoins. We could then start another Bitcoin block chain and start over from square one (only with a much larger confidence in the market, since it worked once!) and reinvest that money if we wanted.<br/>Essentially, no matter what happens there is always the nuclear option of "starting over."<br/>There are much more dangerous and likely attacks to be worried about.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1188 chars): What the OP described is called "cornering the market". When someone tries to buy all the world's supply of a scarce asset, the more they buy the higher the price goes. At some point, it gets too expensive for them to buy any more. It's great for the people who owned it beforehand because they get to sell it to the corner at crazy high prices. As the price keeps going up and up, some people keep holding out for yet higher prices and refuse to sell.<br/>The Hunt brothers famously bankrupted themselves trying to corner the silver market in 1979:<br/>"Brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and Herbert Hunt attempted to corner the world silver markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage holding the rights to more than half of the world's deliverable silver.[1] During Hunt's accumulation of the precious metal silver prices rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to nearly $50 an ounce in January 1980.[2] Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later,[2] much of the fall on a single day now known as Silver Thursday, due to changes made to exchange rules regarding the purchase of commodities on margin.[3]"<br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1504 chars): I second the DHT idea for maintaining a client list - we can't have millions of people relying upon an IRC channel, etc. As far as the scaling issue goes, the issue is not at all HDD space, its network bandwidth. Everyone is forgetting, its not bytes_per_transaction*transactions, which is the number everyone is using. That number, as everyone has said, is fully manageable. No, the number we're interested in is bytes_per_transaction * transactions * number_of_clients * total_hops_beyond_first_between_all_clients_combined<br/>THIS is the amount of bandwidth which the protocol for BTC consumes as the network scales. We're not just talking about sending one copy of each transaction to each client - we're talking about multiple clients broadcasting potentially redundant data to one another, and doing it across numerous hops, meaning numerous rebroadcasts. Much larger number, much more difficult to handle. However, it is manageable, just not in the current incarnation of network handling in the client.<br/>Perhaps in the "popular" phase, BTC chains could be broken up by region, similar to the purviews of domain name authorities now - and there could be an alternative protocol for transactions across these regional boundaries? This would help the raw numbers of the problem, and also cut down on latency and related issues. Not that I think this is an excellent solution - but P2P flooding across all active clients is obviously out barring some massive breakthrough in quantum computing or whatnot.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (804 chars): The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain. In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification. The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks. It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself.<br/>The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed. For now, everyone just runs a full network node.<br/>I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.<br/>At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (125 chars): It seems to do more harm than good because it prevents micropayment implementations such as the one bytemaster is suggesting.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (548 chars): Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments. Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01. The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.<br/>Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods. Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range. But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (2484 chars): I think the current system works fine. If someone wants to implement a micro-payment system then they will have to host enough nodes and contribute enough processing power to include their small transactions. I see no reason to require any node to accept or forward micro-payment transactions if said nodes does not wish to.<br/>The real issue is that even a simple legitimate automated micro-payment system could overload bitcoin by introducing more transactions than the credit card system currently uses. The net result is that block sizes could become HUGE.<br/>In my use case you have a P2P system where they pay for priority downloads. Assume you have a single "torrent" file with 100,000 people all seeding and downloading. That could easily generate 100,000 micro-payments per minute. Now clearly, the program would only have to use BTC in the event that upload != download between two clients.<br/>It would be distributed and thus there would be no easy way to identify "spam" from legitimate usage. Even using my solution of transferring 1+ BTC at a time and giving change if the balance is greater than 0.01 could cause a transaction bloat writ large.<br/>I suspect that the "cost" of handing individual transactions may be low (.00001 BTC) but the cost of handling ALL of those little transactions from millions of users using automated payment negotiation/bidding systems would quickly make it impossible to even listen for all incoming transactions.<br/>The only solution to this problem is to make broadcasting of a transaction "non free". Namely, if you want me to include it you have to pay me. The net (no pun intended) result is that each client would need to pay other clients to whom they even send their transaction, not just the individual who gets it in a block. In this way the laws of economics take over and no one gets a free ride on the transaction broadcast system.<br/>The implication is that you may not even receive notice of payment until a node that you paid to receive your transaction and *attempt* to integrate it into a block manages to do so. This means that you would not even see 0/unconfirmed and that a transaction must make it into a block before anyone that wasn't paid to *attempt* to integrate it even knows it exists.<br/>This structure would encourage pay-to-ip systems because that make the receiver of the payment responsible for paying to get it integrated. Either they run their own bitcoin generators *or* they pay to send the transaction to someone who is.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1607 chars): Forgot to add the good part about micropayments. While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms. Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.<br/>I am not claiming that the network is impervious to DoS attack. I think most P2P networks can be DoS attacked in numerous ways. (On a side note, I read that the record companies would like to DoS all the file sharing networks, but they don't want to break the anti-hacking/anti-abuse laws.)<br/>If we started getting DoS attacked with loads of wasted transactions back and forth, you would need to start paying a 0.01 minimum transaction fee. 0.1.5 actually had an option to set that, but I took it out to reduce confusion. Free transactions are nice and we can keep it that way if people don't abuse them.<br/>That brings up the question: if there was a minimum 0.01 fee for each transaction, should we automatically add the fee if it's just the minimum 0.01? It would be awfully annoying to ask each time. If you have 50.00 and send 10.00, the recipient would get 10.00 and you'd have 39.99 left. I think it should just add it automatically. It's trivial compared to the fees many other types of services add automatically.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (215 chars): Payments would generally be advanced, say 1 BTC at a time and when the connection closes any "change" would be returned. This rule makes it impossible to pay for a simple "search query" with no further transactions.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (811 chars): One alternative is to use a round-up system. You pay for, say, 1000 pages or images or downloads or searches or whatever at a time. When you've used up your 1000 pages, you pay for another 1000 pages. If you only use 1 page, then you have 999 left that you may never use, but it's not a big deal because the cost per 1000 is still small.<br/>Or you could pay per day. The first time you access the site on a given day, you pay for 24 hours of access.<br/>Per 1000 or per day may be easier for consumers to get their heads around too. They worry about per item because it's harder to figure if it might add up too fast. Unlimited for 24 hours they know what the cost will be. Or if 1000 seems like plenty, they're not worrying that it's costing more with each click if they figure 1000 is more than they'll probably use.</p>

When I eventually implement client-only mode, that won't matter much anymore.<br/>There's more work to do on transaction fees. In the event of a flood, you would still be able to jump the queue and get your transactions into the next block by paying a 0.01 transaction fee.

When you've found a block, you should want it to hurry up and broadcast it as soon a possible before someone else finds one and makes yours invalid. The generate thread only changes to higher priority for less than a second every few days.<br/>There should be a 0.3.1 release for this soon. There are a few other issues we need to look at fixing in 0.3.1 before making a release.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (493 chars): On a side note, I've tracked down the other GUI issue.<br/>The "minimize to tray instead of taskbar" is what was eating up all the CPU on my system. After I turned this off, the issue was resolved with Runaway CPU.<br/>This only seems to affect the 64 bit Client, as the 32 bit Clients I have don't seem to be affected by this.<br/>I did notice on the 64 bit Client, what happens is, it spawns multiple "tray" icons until X server finally kills over, so I guess I should submit that as a bug to somewhere?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (347 chars): That's interesting. I know the minimize to tray on Ubuntu is very clunky, but I didn't know it had a CPU peg problem too. Anyone else able to reproduce this problem? We had this feature disabled on Linux before, but then it seemed better to have the imperfect UI than to lose the feature entirely. I'm thinking we should disable it again on Linux.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (591 chars): This is a common point of confusion. There's no such thing as being 1% towards solving a block. You don't make progress towards solving it.

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (260 chars): Then all the CPU time is the generate thread, which definitely runs at the lowest possible priority, idle priority. It's normal that your CPU meter is 100%.

I hope there's not a big hurry to wrap the discussion and decide. How long does Wikipedia typically leave a question like that open for comment?<br/>It would help to condense the article and make it less promotional sounding as soon as possible. Just letting people know what it is, where it fits into the electronic money space, not trying to convince them that it's good. They probably want something that just generally identifies what it is, not tries to explain all about how it works.<br/>If you post in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bitcoin please don't say "yeah, but bitcoin is really important and special so the rules shouldn't apply" or argue that the rule is dumb or unfair. That only makes it worse. Try to address how the rule is satisfied.<br/>Search "bitcoin" on google and see if you can find more big references in addition to the infoworld and slashdot ones. There may be very recent stuff being written by reporters who heard about it from the slashdot article.<br/>I hope it doesn't get deleted. If it does, it'll be hard to overcome the presumption. Institutional momentum is to stick with the last decision. (edit: or at least I assume so, that's how the world usually works, but maybe Wiki is different)</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (174 chars): It's doubtful that SHA2 would be that broken before all coins have been minted. The issue is it then becomes a question of how much it costs to hijack someone's bank account.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (963 chars): SHA256 is not like the step from 128 bit to 160 bit.<br/>To use an analogy, it's more like the step from 32-bit to 64-bit address space. We quickly ran out of address space with 16-bit computers, we ran out of address space with 32-bit computers at 4GB, that doesn't mean we're going to run out again with 64-bit anytime soon.<br/>SHA256 is not going to be broken by Moore's law computational improvements in our lifetimes. If it's going to get broken, it'll be by some breakthrough cracking method. An attack that could so thoroughly vanquish SHA256 to bring it within computationally tractable range has a good chance of clobbering SHA512 too.<br/>If we see a weakness in SHA256 coming gradually, we can transition to a new hash function after a certain block number. Everyone would have to upgrade their software by that block number. The new software would keep a new hash of all the old blocks to make sure they're not replaced with another block with the same old hash.</p>

The Startup folder has the advantage that the end user can see it and manually remove it with the regular UI (not regedit) if they already blew away the Bitcoin directory and its uninstaller.

      <p><b>User</b> (1471 chars): Anyone notice, that for Windows Clients anyway, when you connect a bunch of other clients to it manually (through the -connect option) that if you go over 8, the windows client ends up cutting out the "outside world" connections and stick with the original 8 or more internal machines thinking that it's the entire network?<br/>I never noticed this since I use a Linux client to funnel all my PCs to the outside world, but I tried it with a Windows client and noticed that at first, it had about 10 connections, then after adding another 50 clients internally that connect directly to it, the number would eventually drop down to just "internal clients" only.<br/>When this happens, the block count doesn't increment anymore, basically the Windows client has separated itself from "the network" and all the other clients all think that they are the entire network now. If I do a "netstat -a -n" on the windows client, I can see it's only connected to the Internal clients and the IRC bootstrap channel and basically doesn't to connect to anyone else on the outside world. You know it's happening because the block count starts to fall behind of what is really going on outside of your local network (Internet for the rest of the world)<br/>It's kind of a self-collapsing loop? Doesn't seem to affect Linux clients though, they will happily connect to and be connected to about as many as it can handle. I could see this is kind of a DoS on windows clients if someone was evil enough.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (510 chars): Good point. If you're going to have more than 8 LAN nodes connect to one gateway node, then you'd better have the gateway node set up so it can receive incoming connections. Otherwise, while the gateway node has 8 or more connections, it will not try to add any more outbound connections. As the outside nodes you're connected to come and go, it doesn't make new outbound connections to replace them. You'll be fine if you can accept incoming connections, then there will be plenty of others connecting to you.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (648 chars): I think size (static binary is 8x as big in my case) is not the problem, but security.<br/>Boost, openssl and Berkeley DB are fairly common on unix systems (many things depend on them) and also Wxwidgets (the only argument is that bitcoin uses the current development branch and not the stable branch). Second, static linking doesn't mean you can always run it (in my case it tries to load libpng-1.2, which is not present on my system, libpng-1.4 is, and the static fails to load). Third, openssl hasn't been free of security issues, by statically compiling people keep using the insecure version even if their system provides an updated safe version.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1310 chars): Thanks Insti. I got the man page written. I documented all of the command line switches the program supports, not just the ones in the usage output given by "bitcoin -h". Any of the ones that do not appear in the usage output should have a comment in the man page file noting this (comment lines start with ." which is a period then a double quote).<br/>I provided the update as a patch since I also made some changes to the sourcecode itself. If you want to install the man page first extract it from the diff file with the patch program and then copy the file "bitcoin.1" to section 1 of you man pages. On my Ubuntu systems the directory /usr/local/man/man1/ serves as a good place to keep it. Actually on my systems I put a symlink from there to the bitcoin/trunk/bitcoin.1 file so it stays up to date if it gets updated in SVN.<br/>I have also exported the man page using man2html and will post this to the wiki so people can reference it without having to install it on their systems, as well as for the underprivileged Windows users who have to forgo the true awesomeness of the man page system.<br/>Attached to this message you should find a zip file with the patch in it.<br/>The wiki doesn't seem to be sending the registration e-mail so I can log in to edit, is there some problem with the server or something?<br/>-Buck</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1751 chars): I wondered if they were not really meant to be public facing. I think they are useful to have documented though, at least for now. If the program accepts it as valid input it should be documented. You can either add a notice to the commands in the man-page that are experimental, or just remove them. In my opinion it makes more sense to label them experimental so people know they might change, but can use them if they need to. I would just add the following to the beginning of each of the commands in the makefile:<br/>BUnsupported - Behaviour may change in future versionsR<br/>The B switches on bold text and the R switches back to regular. This way people can use the program to its fullest potential during the development stages. Too much documentation is never a bad thing, especially for an open source project. Since people can see the code they will find these calls anyway and use them whether you want them to or not. If they are documented and marked as volatile then people can at least make an informed choice on whether or not they want to use them.<br/>For example, just at the moment someone in IRC is making use of the -printblock command to generate statistics about the block chain that might help us understand the program better (as in how it performs in the real world). Although the output of this command may change in the future, and therefore we shouldn't be building complex frameworks around it, it is nice to know it exists if you need something done as a quick hack. Also because the program is open source, if someone comes to depend on a certain command line switch they can maintain it. Eventually what you thought was just a temporary debugging tool make end up being one of the most widely used switches available.<br/>-Buck</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (733 chars): I think of my machines running bitcoin as slot machines. I put in CPU time and energy costs in at a regular rate, and once in a while I get money back. If I'm to treat bitcoin as part of a business, then I need to be able to calculate my expected return on investment, just as a casino owner needs to be able to calculate how much money she's making off of her slot machines. I know that the bitcoin generation difficulty will stabilize at some point in the future, but at this point it would be useful to me to be able to calculate my ROI quickly and easily.<br/>So, if nobody else is going to do it, I'll probably make a patch for this. Bitcoin donations appreciated, of course, and would help motivate me to make it available quickly.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (616 chars): Many businesses are like that. For a car salesman, when will the next customer walk in the door?<br/>On the OP's question, it's a good feature, but the question is, how would we word it so people don't expect to get something after that specific amount of time? "it said 7 days and I waited more than a week and didn't get anything!" Approx, average, but still they're going to think that way. It can't be a whole sentence, unless we think of somewhere else to put it, but where would that be? Suggestions?<br/>The difficulty quadrupled a few minutes ago to 181.54. It's going to take typically about a week to generate now.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (268 chars): a prepaid account with the snack machine company works great for snack machines in corporate cafeterias (or other places with a fairly static consumer base) not so much for areas with a large transitory consumer base, such as airports, ferry boats, train stations etc.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1358 chars): I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.<br/>The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they receive to incorporate into the block they're trying to generate. When you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it's a race to propagate to the most nodes first. If one has a slight head start, it'll geometrically spread through the network faster and get most of the nodes.<br/>A rough back-of-the-envelope example:<br/>1 0<br/>4 1<br/>16 4<br/>64 16<br/>80% 20%<br/>So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage.<br/>The payment processor has connections with many nodes. When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends. If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad. A double-spent transaction wouldn't get very far without one of the listeners hearing it. The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor's broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (993 chars): We should queue up a supply of pre-made addresses in the wallet to use when a new address is needed. They aren't very big, so it wouldn't hurt to have a lot of them. This would more generally cover the case also where someone backs up, then requests a new address and receives a big payment with it. Maybe there should be separate queues so one type of demand on addresses doesn't deplete it for the others.<br/>The addresses would be created and stored in the normal place, but also listed on a separate list of created-but-never-used addresses. When an address is requested, the address at the front of the never-used queue is handed out, and a new address is created and added to the back.<br/>There's some kind of rescan in the block loading code that was made to repair the case where someone copied their wallet.dat. I would need to check that the rescan handles the case of rediscovering received payments in blocks that were already received, but are forgotten because the wallet was restored.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1183 chars): After further research... I think the Transmission approach, combined with the existing "only allow connections from 127.0.0.1" is a good short/medium-term solution.<br/>Putting the username:password in a settings.json file in the Bitcoin directory aught to work nicely (since Bitcoin can already parse JSON). And keeping the authentication stuff off the command line and in the HTTP headers instead of the JSON request params is nice and clean.<br/>Long term, the "right" way to do authenticated, secure JSON-RPC is with client-side certificates and https. But that looks like it would be a lot of work to implement and a big learning curve for users to figure out how to generate client-side certificates and how to get both sides of the JSON-RPC connection using them. And I'm not even certain a full-blown client certificate solution would solve the problem of malicious Javascript making JSON-RPC requests via XMLHttpRequests to localhost; if the user installed the client certificate in the browser (because maybe there was a nifty JSON-RPC-powered web front-end to controlling Bitcoin), would the browser automatically send the client certificate if a malicious website made requests?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (719 chars): So you drop a settings file in the ~/.bitcoin directory, that sounds better. In the "no password is set" warning, it could tell you where the file is and what to do.<br/>What is the most popular and common settings file format?<br/>HTTP basic authentication should be considered. In actual practice though, it's more work for web developers to figure out how to specify the password through some extra parameter in the HTTP or JSON-RPC wrapper than to just stick an extra parameter at the beginning of the parameter list. What do you think? Does HTTP basic authentication get us any additional benefits? Moving it off the parameter list but then you still have to specific it in a more esoteric place I'm not sure is a net win.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (546 chars): If you're using another JSON-RPC client that you wrote you can take care to protect the password, but using the bitcoin binary as the client and passing the password on the command line has the same issue as starting the daemon with it. It's still visible to every user that way.<br/>So both the server and the client mode invocation need to use the file and not accept the password on the command line. Generally programs like this refuse to start if the mode on the file isn't 600 or something like that, because that means other users can read it.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (714 chars): Still need to know what's the most typical settings file format on Linux. Is there a standard file extension? I've never seen a settings file using JSON, and it doesn't look very human friendly with everything required to be in quotes. I think what I usually see is like:<br/># comment<br/>setting=value<br/>Is there a settings file thing in Boost?<br/>When you're using bitcoind to issue commands from the command line as a client, can we have it get the password from the settings file then too?<br/>Gavin pointed out I forgot to increment the column of numbers in CommandLineRPC, so the current -rpcpw= implementation doesn't work right from the command line with non-string parameters. (JSON-RPC is fine) Still under construction.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (51 chars): You could do worse than using yaml for the settings</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1616 chars): I was researching config file formats, here's a comparison.<br/>YAML is massive. I'm not sure there's a lightweight easy to build library we can integrate into our project. Seems overkill.<br/>JSON is tempting and I'm inclined to like it, but two main sticking points:<br/>1) No comments! How can you have a config file where you can't comment out a line to disable it?<br/>2) Not very user friendly to have to "quote" all the strings, including the keys, and also have to remember the comma at the end of lines.<br/>{<br/>"key" : "value",<br/>}<br/>I suppose we could easily preprocess JSON reading the config file one line at a time, truncate the lines at any # character (and/or "//"?), concatenate them into a string and pass it to JSON, so you could go:<br/># comment<br/>"key" : "value", # still have to remember the comma<br/>"key2" : "value", // comment like this or both<br/>Boost has boost::program_options.<br/>We could read lines ourselves and feed them into a map&lt;string, string&gt; mapConfig.<br/>while (!eof)<br/>read line<br/>if '#' found, truncate line<br/>split line at first ':' -&gt; key, value<br/>mapConfig.insert(key, value)<br/>If we use the syntax:<br/># comment<br/>key : value<br/>...and don't allow whitespace indenting before the keys, I guess we would be a subset of YAML and could switch to YAML someday if we need more complexity.<br/>If we go with self parsed, that doesn't mean we can't use JSON on particular parameter values as needed. If an option needs a list or more structured data, it could always parse its value as json:<br/>key : ["item1", "item2", "item3"]<br/>Although it has to be all on one line then.<br/>I guess I'm leaning towards self parsed mapConfig:<br/># comment<br/>key : value</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (419 chars): I strongly disagree; software should be secure by default, and running bitcoind without a password (or bitcoin -server) is definitely NOT secure.<br/>I just don't see somebody saying "Man, Bitcoin sucks because I have to add a password to a configuration file before running it as a daemon." I can see somebody saying "Man, Bitcoin sucks because I accidently ran it with the -server switch and somebody stole all my money."</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (884 chars): I don't think authentication should be disabled by default if there's no conf file or the config file doesn't contain "rpcpassword", but what if it contains "rpcpassword="?<br/>I can see both points.<br/>What if the programmer can't figure out how to do HTTP authentication in their language (Fortran or whatever) or it's not even supported by their JSON-RPC library? Should they be able to explicitly disable the password requirement?<br/>OTOH, what if there's a template conf file, with<br/>rpcpassword= # fill in a password here<br/>There are many systems that don't allow you to log in without a password. This forum, for instance. Gavin's point seems stronger.<br/>BTW, I haven't tested it, but I hope having rpcpassword= in the conf file is valid. It's only if you use -server or -daemon or bitcoind that it should fail with a warning. If it doesn't need the password, it should be fine. Is that right?</p>

The server still works fine with properly behaving clients.<br/>This can be solved by removing the newlines (and maybe '<br/>'s) from result at the end of the Base64Encode function:<br/>result.erase(std::remove(result.begin(), result.end(), '<br/>'), result.end());<br/>result.erase(std::remove(result.begin(), result.end(), '<br/>'), result.end());</p>

If it contains multiple responses and one is an error, I wonder if that makes the status 500 for the whole thing, I guess so. Maybe it should always return 200. I think someone sounded like the 500 might be causing a problem.<br/>This probably gets fixed after 0.3.3. Until then, just use single invocation. I wonder if any JSON-RPC package even supports multiple invocation, probably not.<br/>It would be nice if we could pin down better how multiple-invocation is supposed to work, if at all, before trying to fix it, and whether returning HTTP status 500 for error response is right.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (978 chars): I am convinced that bandwidth, disk space, and computation time necessary to distribute and "finalize" a transaction will be prohibitively expensive for micro-payments. Consider for a second that the current banking industry is unable to provide a reasonable micropayment solution that does not involve depositing a reasonable sum and only allowing a withdraw after a reasonable sum has been accumulated.<br/>Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good. It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.<br/>Thus we need bit-banks that allow instant transfers among members and peer banks. Anyone can open a bit-bank but the system would, by necessity operate on some level of trust. Transfers in and out of the banks and peer-to-peer would still be possible but will be more costly. Thus, a bit bank could make money by enabling transfers cheaper and faster than the swarm with the added risk of trusting the bank. A bank has to maintain trust to make money.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (404 chars): The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (475 chars): FLATDATA was a workaround to serialize a fixed field length array. There was a cleaner way to make it understand how to serialize arrays directly, but MSVC6 couldn't do it and I wanted to keep compatibility with MSVC6 at that time. We don't support MSVC6 anymore because we use something in Boost that doesn't. We lost support for it after 0.2.0. Maybe someday I'll swap in the clean way that just knows how to serialize fixed length arrays without wrapping them in FLATDATA.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (646 chars): I think there is a pretty significant crypto flaw in Bitcoin as currently implemented. I'm not sure it is exploitable now (I'm not a real cryptohacker) but it is more than plausible that will be in the near future.<br/>The flaw would enable anonymous stealing of coins from arbitrary bitcoin addresses. And no it doesn't involve solving any of the hard problems that keep existing crypto systems secure. It is simply a *potential* correctable logic flaw in the implementation.<br/>I would like bitcoins to succeed, so I'd rather not jump up and down in public yelling about flaws in public.

Please go ahead and post it (and relieve the suspense for everyone!)<br/>His point is that transactions paid to a Bitcoin Address are only as secure as the hash function.

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (720 chars): You would still have to sign it with public key 654321. You need to find a collision using a public key for which you know the private key.<br/>When you claim a Bitcoin Address transaction, you give your public key that matches the hash, then you must sign it with that key.<br/>Red's point is that it's easy to quickly generate insecure public keys which you could break and find the private key after you find a collision.<br/>He points out that if the public key was required to be a secure one, one which must have required significant work to find the prime numbers, that would increase the strength above that of the hash function alone. Someone trying to brute force would have to take time generating a key for each attempt.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (208 chars): Here is a paper that claims to find SHA-1 collisions in 2^52 crypto operations. And optimally secure hash would take 2^80 operations. 2^52 time is still large, but it is getting into cluster and botnet range.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1339 chars): 2^80 is if you can use a birthday attack. You can't use a birthday attack for this, so the difficulty is the full 2^160 bits. Although, if you were trying to crack any one of 1 million (2^20) transactions, you could do a partial birthday attack 2^160/2^20 = 2^140.<br/>Bitcoin Addresses are the only place where 160-bit hash is used. Everything else is SHA-256. They're calculated as:<br/>bitcoinaddress = RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(publickey))<br/>Correct me if I'm wrong (please, and I'll gladly eat crow) but I think it would be hard to use an analytical attack on RIPEMD-160 in this case. An analytical attack prescribes a certain range or pattern of inputs to try that will greatly increase your chance of finding a collision. Here, you don't have that kind of control over RIPEMD-160's input, because the input is the output of SHA-256. If an analytical attack helps you find an input to RIPEMD-160 that produces a collision, what are you going to do with it? You still have to get SHA-256 to output that value, so you would still have to break SHA-256 too.<br/>For brute force, RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(x)) is no stronger than RIPEMD-160 alone. But for analytical attack, it seems like you must analytical attack both RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256. If I'm wrong, then the strength is the same as RIPEMD-160 and the SHA-256 only serves as one round of key strengthening.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1147 chars): So the way I read it.<br/>Given two numbers p and q. Which for RSA are supposed to be large primes.<br/>Then n = p*q<br/>The public key is the two fields (n, e). e is called the public exponent and appears to be chosen from a set of common values.<br/>The private key is also two fields (n, d). d is called the private exponent it it is derived by knowing e, p-1, and q-1.<br/>The trick is, it is really hard to factor n into p & q. Therefore it is equally as hard to find p-1 and q-1<br/>My postulation is that if n is arbitrary, and e is one of the common values, then there are lots of different p, q pairs that would work. The less prime the numbers the easier to find p and q, and therefore p-1 and q-1. And if you have a big block of arbitrary data that give you lots of flexibility in trying to collide a hash.<br/>(That is the point where I could be totally off base though. Really interested, if a crypto geek knows better than me.)<br/>I did read that the key generation algorithms create p and q such that they are "very likely prime" but it is too much work to know for sure. This leads me to believe non-primes don't cause any obvious FAILs. I could be wrong though.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (171 chars): Sorry, actually it's ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) not RSA. I shouldn't have said "prime numbers". ECDSA doesn't take much time to generate a keypair.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (351 chars): I was able to integrate the SHA256 functionality from Crypto++ 5.6.0 into Bitcoin. This is the fastest SHA256 yet using the SSE2 assembly code. Since Bitcoin was sending unaligned data to the block hash function, I had to change the MOVDQA instruction to MOVDQU.<br/>I think using the SHA256 functionality from Crypto++ 5.6.0 is the way forward right now.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (794 chars): I added a subset of the Crypto++ 5.6.0 library to the SVN. I stripped it down to just SHA and 11 general dependency files. There shouldn't be any other crypto in there other than SHA.<br/>I aligned the data fields and it worked. The ASM SHA-256 is about 48% faster. The combined speedup is about 2.5x faster than version 0.3.3.<br/>I guess it's using SSE2. It automatically sets its build configuration at compile time based on the compiler environment.<br/>It looks like it has some SSE2 detection at runtime, but it's hard to tell if it actually uses it to fall back if it's not available. I want the release builds to have SSE2. SSE2 has been around since the first Pentium 4. A Pentium 3 or older would be so slow, you'd be wasting your electricity trying to generate on it anyway.<br/>This is SVN rev 114.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1281 chars): As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:<br/>- boring grey in colour<br/>- not a good conductor of electricity<br/>- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either<br/>- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose<br/>and one special, magical property:<br/>- can be transported over a communications channel<br/>If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.<br/>Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.<br/>I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.<br/>(I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1038 chars): What are you needing to use listtransactions for?<br/>The reason I didn't implement listtransactions is I want to make sure web programmers don't use it. It would be very easy to latch onto that for watching for received payments. There is no reliable way to do it that way and make sure nothing can slip through the cracks. Until we have solid example code using getreceivedbyaddress and getreceivedbylabel to point to and say "use this! use this! don't use listtransactions!", I don't think we should implement listtransactions.<br/>When we do implement listtransactions, maybe one way to fight that is to make it all text. It should not break down the fields into e.g. comment, confirmations, credit, debit. It could be one pretty formatted string like "0/unconfirmed 0:0:0 date comment debit 4 credit 0" or something so it's hard for programmers to do the wrong thing and process it. It's only for viewing the status of your server. I guess that would be kinda annoying for web interfaces that would rather format it into html columns though.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (304 chars): Since it's a non breaking change, it should be done as soon as possible in my opinion, for those very reasons.<br/>The question remains, is anyone willing to help implement it? I'm an experience programmer but I have no C++ experience unfortunately, so I'm gonna need a little help if I try to do this myself</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1430 chars): The reason I didn't use protocol buffers or boost serialization is because they looked too complex to make absolutely airtight and secure. Their code is too large to read and be sure that there's no way to form an input that would do something unexpected.<br/>I hate reinventing the wheel and only resorted to writing my own serialization routines reluctantly. The serialization format we have is as dead simple and flat as possible. There is no extra freedom in the way the input stream is formed. At each point, the next field in the data structure is expected. The only choices given are those that the receiver is expecting. There is versioning so upgrades are possible.<br/>CAddress is about the only object with significant reserved space in it. (about 7 bytes for flags and 12 bytes for possible future IPv6 expansion)<br/>The larger things we have like blocks and transactions can't be optimized much more for size. The bulk of their data is hashes and keys and signatures, which are uncompressible. The serialization overhead is very small, usually 1 byte for size fields.<br/>On Gavin's idea about an existing P2P broadcast infrastructure, I doubt one exists. There are few P2P systems that only need broadcast. There are some libraries like Chord that try to provide a distributed hash table infrastructure, but that's a huge difficult problem that we don't need or want. Those libraries are also much harder to install than ourselves.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1503 chars): if the buyer refuses to finalise the transaction and the seller refuses to permit a refund, they have 2 choices.<br/>1) be spiteful and nobody will get anything<br/>2) agree on a third party to send the money to. that third party will be an arbitrator who will weigh up both sides of the argument and come to a decision as to who should be returned the money, minus whatever fee they agreed with the two hurt parties.<br/>Subsequent to this, I also realised that my suggestion is open to trolling whereby a seller makes someone do an escrow transaction and then refuses to ship anything or arbitrate, my solution to this issue gives the following modification of the system:<br/>the buyer makes an escrow transaction which is then presented to the seller, if the seller wants to go ahead, they must agree to be debited a sum stipulated by the buyer, the seller agrees and the escrow transaction then goes into the network for inclusion into the block chain, both parties are now down on their money.<br/>if everything goes to plan, the buyer OKs the release of the funds and the seller gets the payment + his "trust deposit" returned.<br/>if the buyer wishes to cancel, the seller authorises the cancellation and both parties get their original funds back.<br/>if nobody can agree on a release, both parties now have an incentive to go to an arbitrator, when the arbitrator is authorised to receive the transaction funds, the trust deposit gets immediately returned to the seller, the arbitrator doesn't get a say over those funds.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (424 chars): A transaction can be written that requires two signatures to spend it next. You write a payment that requires the signature of both the recipient and the sender to spend it. To release the escrow, you give the recipient the signature for your half, or the payee can return it by giving you his signed half. There's no mediator in this simple case. The recourse is to refuse to ever release it, essentially burning the money.</p>

Are you planning to do anything on this regard? I'm sure I can find my way around to do it myself, it will just take time, but I don't want to duplicate any work though.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (926 chars): I have the beginning of something like this.

I think blank account name ("") will be your default account. If you sell something to a user, you could do move "theiraccount" "" 123.45.<br/>Is "move" the best name for this? I shied away from "transfer" because that sounds too close to sending a transaction.<br/>I'm thinking a new function getaccountaddress instead of overloading getnewaddress:<br/>getaccountaddress &lt;account&gt;<br/>Gives you an address allocated from getnewaddress &lt;account&gt;. It'll keep giving the same address until something is received on the address, then it allocates a new address.

      <p><b>User</b> (486 chars): As an overall point, I also do not agree with the idea that the very high computational burden of coin generation is in fact a necessity of the current system. As I understand it, currency creation is fundamentally metered by TIME - and if that is the fundamental controlling variable, what is the need for everyone to "roll as many dice as posible" within that given time period? The "chain of proof" for coin ownership and transactions doesn't depend on the method for spawning coins.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1050 chars): Each node's influence on the network is proportional to its CPU power. The only way to show the network how much CPU power you have is to actually use it.<br/>If there's something else each person has a finite amount of that we could count for one-person-one-vote, I can't think of it. IP addresses... much easier to get lots of them than CPUs.<br/>I suppose it might be possible to measure CPU power at certain times. For instance, if the CPU power challenge was only run for an average of 1 minute every 10 minutes. You could still prove your total power at given times without running it all the time. I'm not sure how that could be implemented though. There's no way for a node that wasn't present at the time to know that a past chain was actually generated in a duty cycle with 9 minute breaks, not back to back.<br/>Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen. We don't have to worry about a chain of custody of communication. It doesn't matter who tells you a longest chain, the proof-of-work speaks for itself.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1778 chars): The power used is not wasteful. It is simply what the owner is willing to commit to the project. Even so, it may be used even as "waste heat". I am an electritian by trade, and years ago I had the following idea form, while installing a 'heat trace' network on insulated sprinkler lines inside an open air parking garage.<br/>The 'heat trace' is a fairly expensive cable that has a continuous resistive core to produce low intensity electric heat along the length of the pipe that it's taped onto. Insulation is then wrapped around this assembly. The best, and most efficient, systems have a temp reactive core; so that the closer to the freezing point that the cable itself becomes at any given length, the lower the resistance across the core becomes, resulting in an increase in heat output along the colder and less well insulated sections.<br/>At the time, I was playing with an early form of distributed computing called "Condor", which allowed single processes to be exported to other computers upon a network and their disk I/O shipped back across the network to a master server without the process being able to tell the difference. I thought then that a small "computer on a chip" wired upon a flat network cable would be able to effectively perform the same functions of keeping the pipes above freezing with local temp sensitivity while also crunching numbers in exactly the same way that bitcoin requires. Such an idea would require a network that permited quite a bit of power in order to not need an unacceptable number of power points along the pipe, but imagine the usefulness of such a system for companies that have such needs in very high (or very low) latitudes.<br/>What if such a system were retrofitted onto the Alaskan Oil Pipeline, for example, one mile at a time?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (525 chars): The heat from your computer is not wasted if you need to heat your home. If you're using electric heat where you live, then your computer's heat isn't a waste. It's equal cost if you generate the heat with your computer.<br/>If you have other cheaper heating than electric, then the waste is only the difference in cost.<br/>If it's summer and you're using A/C, then it's twice.<br/>Bitcoin generation should end up where it's cheapest. Maybe that will be in cold climates where there's electric heat, where it would be essentially free.</p>

You can't get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered, would you do it? Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it'll be useless to them, although you still lose it too? If they give it back, you can re-activate it.<br/>Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen. If the thief gives it back, it turns to gold again.<br/>It still seems to me the problem may be one of presenting it the right way. For one thing, not being so blunt about "money burning" for the purposes of game theory discussion. The money is never truly burned. You have the option to release it at any time forever.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (71 chars): Interesting idea to revisit! Thanks. Hadn't thought of them in a while.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (971 chars): This is a very interesting topic. If a solution was found, a much better, easier, more convenient implementation of Bitcoin would be possible.<br/>Originally, a coin can be just a chain of signatures. With a timestamp service, the old ones could be dropped eventually before there's too much backtrace fan-out, or coins could be kept individually or in denominations. It's the need to check for the absence of double-spends that requires global knowledge of all transactions.<br/>The challenge is, how do you prove that no other spends exist? It seems a node must know about all transactions to be able to verify that. If it only knows the hash of the in/outpoints, it can't check the signatures to see if an outpoint has been spent before. Do you have any ideas on this?<br/>It's hard to think of how to apply zero-knowledge-proofs in this case.<br/>We're trying to prove the absence of something, which seems to require knowing about all and checking that the something isn't included.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (286 chars): It's hard for me too! :-) Was interesting to re-read though!<br/>Was hoping it would spawn some insight on a way for nodes to demonstrate that they "always follow" the block generating rules, in absence of everyone needing to have the set of all transactions to double check.<br/>It didn't. :-)</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1648 chars): Still thinking this idea through...<br/>The only job the network needs to do is to tell whether a spend of an outpoint is the first or not.<br/>If we're willing to have clients keep the history for their own money, then some of the information may not need to be stored by the network, such as:<br/>- the value<br/>- the association of inpoints and outpoints in one transaction<br/>The network would track a bunch of independent outpoints. It doesn't know what transactions or amounts they belong to. A client can find out if an outpoint has been spent, and it can submit a satisfying inpoint to mark it spent. The network keeps the outpoint and the first valid inpoint that proves it spent. The inpoint signs a hash of its associated next outpoint and a salt, so it can privately be shown that the signature signs a particular next outpoint if you know the salt, but publicly the network doesn't know what the next outpoint is.<br/>I believe the clients would have to keep the entire history back to the original generated coins. Someone sending a payment would have to send data to the recipient, as well as still communicating with the network to mark outpoints spent and check that the spend is the first spend. Maybe the data transfer could be done as an e-mail attachment.<br/>The fact that clients have to keep the entire history reduces the privacy benefit. Someone handling a lot of money still gets to see a lot of transaction history. The way it retrospectively fans out, they might end up seeing a majority of the history. Denominations could be made granular to limit fan-out, but a business handling a lot of money might still end up seeing a lot of the history.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (2924 chars): If a client joined the network recently, it did so presuming that prior validators followed the rules and all pre-existing blocks are valid. (No one would join a known corrupt network)<br/>Sure, in the current system, if transactions were never purged, a new node could validate all prior blocks for self consistency. But they still couldn't prove absolute truth. A bot net could have taken over and erased some transactions leaving "a new truth" and unhappy users. Equivalent to case 1) above.<br/>In the current system, if transactions were Merkle tree purged then you have case 2) above. New comers must trust in the process. Anything missing, they don't need to worry about. Everyone must presume it was valid.<br/>The unique thing I'm saying is that, if you have confidence in the bitcoin validation competition process (and we do!), then you really don't need "a 2) thoroughly deep block" to be very deep at all. Someone said in another thread that clients reject any changes to blocks more than two hours old. So we can have absolute confidence in all blocks buried 12 deep.<br/>So if a transaction is unspent and buried 12 deep, we can purge all it's ancestors. They add warm fuzzies but no additional validation. We have to rely on them. There is simply no way to back up and change course.<br/>After that, every succeeding block presumes all the preceding blocks are true. Otherwise it would be a fork and not a succeeding block. So for any transaction validated against out-points in a preceding block, if those out-points exist and are unspent, they must be presumed valid. If those are presumed valid, their ancestors must be presumed valid even if purged.<br/>---<br/>In the proposed system, exactly the same things are true.<br/>If an antecedent out-point hash is unspent and buried 12 blocks deep, then it is absolutely unspent. Nothing can change that fact. No point in checking its ancestors. You can finish validating the transaction, cancel the in-points hashes and create new out-point hashes.<br/>Interestingly, if an antecedent out-point hash is unspent and buried LESS THAN 12 blocks deep, then it is RELATIVELY unspent. Curiously, there is still no point in checking its ancestors. The only thing that could change the antecedent's validity is a branch swap to a longer chain. If an ancestor of the antecedent you are validating this transaction against was swapped out, this transaction would be swapped out as well.<br/>It's one of those cheesy time machine movie plots. Someone when back in time and spent my ancestor. Now I don't exist!<br/>=====<br/>So what I'm saying is that in BOTH systems (existing and proposed) the only thing validators need to do is to validate that the antecedent out-points exist and are unspent (for the current block chain). The process assures that everything else remains relatively or absolutely valid.<br/>The rest is just warm fuzzies.<br/>-- PS --<br/>I know this is too long and redundant, but I'm to tired to edit. :-)</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (2028 chars): I'm not grasping your idea yet. Does it hide any information from the public network? What is the advantage?<br/>If at least 50% of nodes validated transactions enough that old transactions can be discarded, then everyone saw everything and could keep a record of it.<br/>Can public nodes see the values of transactions? Can they see which previous transaction the value came from? If they can, then they know everything. If they can't, then they couldn't verify that the value came from a valid source, so you couldn't take their generated chain as verification of it.<br/>Does it hide the bitcoin addresses? Is that it? OK, maybe now I see, if that's it.<br/>Crypto may offer a way to do "key blinding". I did some research and it was obscure, but there may be something there. "group signatures" may be related.<br/>There's something here in the general area:<br/>http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/hopwood/crypto/rh/<br/>What we need is a way to generate additional blinded variations of a public key. The blinded variations would have the same properties as the root public key, such that the private key could generate a signature for any one of them. Others could not tell if a blinded key is related to the root key, or other blinded keys from the same root key. These are the properties of blinding. Blinding, in a nutshell, is x = (x * large_random_int) mod m.<br/>When paying to a bitcoin address, you would generate a new blinded key for each use.<br/>Then you need to be able to sign a signature such that you can't tell that two signatures came from the same private key. I'm not sure if always signing a different blinded public key would already give you this property. If not, I think that's where group signatures comes in. With group signatures, it is possible for something to be signed but not know who signed it.<br/>As an example, say some unpopular military attack has to be ordered, but nobody wants to go down in history as the one who ordered it. If 10 leaders have private keys, one of them could sign the order and you wouldn't know who did it.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1767 chars): I agree that eventually the latter will have to be done. It's for the reasons you pointed out that my DHT solution has flaws. Curiously it's all a side effect of not being able to implement the former constraint.<br/>If you allow validating nodes to arbitrarily ignore transactions you risk breaking the key requirement that all validating nodes receive and record all transactions. The current presumption is that all validators try to receive and record all transactions. If a transaction is non-uniformly delayed and missed by the node who completes the block, it is presumed that statistically the transaction would be recorded in a subsequent block. However, that requires continually rebroadcasting the transaction to assure it gets through.<br/>Let's say throughput was right and there was an advantage to a node saying, "I'm only willing to take 5 transactions a 10 block period." in that case it still generates blocks that can't be rejected by others, but an increasing number of unrecorded transactions backlogs with each minimal block. This causes additional retransmissions exacerbating the bandwidth problem.<br/>In effect you rely on unrestricted nodes to compensate for a problem caused by restricted nodes. So if the restricted nodes are causing problems and doing less validation and recording work than other nodes, why should they be rewarded equally for generating blocks? That seems counter productive.<br/>It would be better to say, "record all transactions or you can't be a validator!" Less validators means less bandwidth usage overall. It also becomes easier to spot abusers.<br/>----ps----<br/>An zero knowledge proof-of-completeness would be for competing validators to reject a proof-of-work block if it didn't contain 99% of the known outstanding transactions.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (801 chars): It doesn't have to be such a breaking change. New nodes could accept old transactions for a long time until most nodes have already upgraded before starting to refuse transactions without PoW. Or, they could always accept old transactions, but only a limited number per time period.<br/>I've thought about PoW on transactions many times, but usually I end up thinking a 0.01 transaction fee is essentially similar and better. 0.01 is basically a proof of work, but not wasted. But if the problem is validating loads of transactions, then PoW could be checked faster.<br/>A more general umbrella partial solution would be to implement the idea where an unlikely dropoff in blocks received is detected. Then an attacker would still need a substantial portion of the network's power to benefit from a DoS attack.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (510 chars): From what I understand a node will not include transactions in it's blocks unless the transaction includes a fee that meets the node's requirements. So in the case of a node setting the fee to 1,000 it would likely never include any transactions in blocks it generates, which means it will miss out on any transaction fees other nodes would have gotten. There really isn't a reason to set a nodes requirements higher then the rest of the network since you are basically just pricing yourself out of the market.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (387 chars): No, that's not what it is.<br/>-paytxfee allows you to include a transaction fee with your transactions. If transaction confirmations become slow, you can get priority by using "-paytxfee=0.01". Any transactions you send would cost an extra 0.01. There's no reason to use more than 0.01.<br/>It's just there in case we need it. It probably won't be needed, and it can be explained more if we do.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (656 chars): This is a good point. I don't think I underestimated people's ability to generate bitcoins efficiently and legitimately - the difficulty adjustment does a good job of compensating for that, and that makes it a non-issue in my scenario. But I probably underestimated the effect of minters using other people's resources without their knowledge and consent. The FAQ theorizes that the cost of minting will approach the price of electricity minus a thin profit margin, and I probably accepted that theory too uncritically. If resource theft becomes the primary way to finance bitcoin minting, flaws in the difficulty adjustment will have a more subtle impact.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1089 chars): Some places where generation will gravitate to:<br/>1) places where it's cheapest or free<br/>2) people who want to help for idealogical reasons<br/>3) people who want to get some coins without the inconvenience of doing a transaction to buy them<br/>There are legitimate places where it's free. Generation is basically free anywhere that has electric heat, since your computer's heat is offsetting your baseboard electric heating. Many small flats have electric heat out of convenience.<br/>How expensive is heating oil? With the price of oil so high, if it's actually more expensive than electric, then generating would have negative cost.<br/>There's also kids putting it on their parent's power bill, employees their employer, botnets, etc.<br/>Case 3 comes into play for small amounts. The overhead of doing an exchange doesn't make sense if you just need a small bit of pocket change for incidental micropayments. I think this is a nice advantage vs fiat currency, instead of all the seigniorage going to one big entity, let it go in convenience amounts to people who need to scrape up a small amount of change.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (351 chars): 1) Once more than 50% of the node power is upgraded and the good chain overtakes the bad, the 0.3.10 nodes will make it hard for any bad transactions to get any confirmations.<br/>2) If you didn't remove your blk*.dat files, you're not helping to contribute to that 50%, and you'll still show bad transactions until the good chain overtakes the bad chain.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (360 chars): Of course, this happened right after the difficulty kicked up to 511.7, so all these new "good" blocks will have to contend with that.

      <p><b>User</b> (358 chars): Yes. The only exception would be if an unpatched client made another fake transaction and managed to verify it. They would be able to spread that fake block to a few other nodes that haven't upgraded, but the upgraded clients seem to have more power than the unpatched clients, so the bad link would not last long and would not be spread by upgraded clients.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (642 chars): Un-upgraded nodes have the correct chain most of the time, but they are still trying to include the overflow transaction in every block, so they're continually trying to fork and generate invalid blocks. If an old version node is restarted, its transaction pool is emptied, so it may generate valid blocks for a while until the transaction gets broadcast again. 0.3.9 and lower nodes still must upgrade.<br/>The SVN now has the code we needed to automatically reorg the block chain without having to delete the blk*.dat files manually. I knew I couldn't write that code fast and carefully enough yesterday, so I went with the quick manual option.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (334 chars): I suspect there's some difficulty receiving blocks if all the nodes you're connected to are 0.3.9 or lower. We need enough of us so that at least one node you connect to will be 0.3.10. The problem will start to go away when we make up more than 1/8th of the network.<br/>It'll help if you port forward so you can get lots of connections.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (305 chars): Hmm, it seems I am missing something important - disconnecting transactions which are no longer part of the accepted block chain. I'm going to have to work on this a bit - the naive approach of simply blasting away all TXNs, then reconnecting things is far too slow, and hits the transaction memory limit.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1420 chars): That's a difficult approach.<br/>We need to cause a reorg, which will disconnect the invalid chain.<br/>This is code that will rarely ever get tested, and is fairly intricate, so something simple and safe is best.<br/>Here's what I was thinking of. (I haven't tested this yet) It checks all the blocks in the main chain. If it finds a bad one, it sets all that chain's bnChainWork to 0 so it can't win best chain again, and it reduces best chain work to the fork level so any new block after the fork will cause a reorg. (It can't change pindexBest without actually doing a reorg)<br/>This isn't perfect yet. It still needs to receive one valid block to trigger the reorg.<br/>It would probably be possible to initiate an AddToBlockIndex or Reorganize after the check, but it would require a lot more careful attention. I probably should break out part of AddToBlockIndex that sets the new best block. I'll probably end up doing that instead of the code below.<br/>bool CTxDB::LoadBlockIndex()<br/>{<br/>...<br/>// Verify blocks in the main chain<br/>vector&lt;CBlockIndex*&gt; vChain;<br/>for (CBlockIndex* pindex = pindexBest; pindex && pindex-&gt;pprev; pindex = pindex-&gt;pprev)<br/>{<br/>vChain.push_back(pindex);<br/>CBlock block;<br/>if (!block.ReadFromDisk(pindex))<br/>return error("LoadBlockIndex() : block.ReadFromDisk failed");<br/>if (!block.CheckBlock())<br/>{<br/>bnBestChainWork = pindex-&gt;pprev-&gt;bnChainWork;<br/>foreach(CBlockIndex* pindex2, vChain)<br/>pindex2-&gt;bnChainWork = 0;<br/>}<br/>}<br/>return true;<br/>}</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1749 chars): There has been a lot of debate about what Bitcoins are -- i.e. currency vs. commodity. Also there has been a lot of debate about inflation vs. deflation with respect to Bitcoins, whether people would lend them, at what rates, etc.<br/>I think the most apt description of Bitcoins is that they are shares of stock in this communal Bitcoin enterprise we are undertaking. It is a lot like being part of a company (right now a very small company) and being paid in stock shares. There are a fixed number of Bitcoins, as there are a fixed number of shares in a company (barring new issues/etc.).<br/>The primary value of Bitcoins right now is the hope that they will someday be worth significantly more than they are right now. For that to happen, the Bitcoin enterprise as a whole needs to gain collective value. We, as employee/owners of Bitcoin need to generate that added value. The most obvious way is to facilitate internet commerce by bartering shares of Bitcoin for other goods. The collective computational effort of all the employee/owners helps ensure that the barter is fair by keeping a record of each transaction. The individual efforts of some Bitcoiners are helping to make the barter of Bitcoins easier or more useful.<br/>Regarding lending/borrowing of Bitcoins, to me it is analogous to lending/borrowing stock. The primary reason to borrow Bitcoins would be because you think they are overvalued and will be worth less when you have to return them. When you borrow the Bitcoins, you can sell them now (barter them now) and hopefully it will cost you less to buy them back at a later date so that you can return them to your lender (probably plus a fee).<br/>In essence, Bitcoins are like a "direct public offering" of stock in the Bitcoin enterprise.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1290 chars): Yes, but there are two points that you overlooked. First, the software transceiver ususally requires four of these chips. (two for receive and two for transmit, one does digital signal processing and the other does digital filtering of the raw signal. Said another way, one is the virtual mike/speaker and the other is a virtual tuner. Not all such software radio setups need four, however) So if a ham has four of these, all four could be programmed to this end. The other point is one that I didn't explicitly mention, one FPGA does not equal only one sha-256 processor. It is possible, even likely, that more than one such processor could be programmed into a single FPGA chip. These chips are fairly large so that they can 'virtualize' some pretty complex logic circuts, and a talented programmer could program one chip to be several sha-256 processors running in parrallel. All this, and his main CPU and GPU are still available if still more Kh/s are desired. Any hacker with the skills to program one or more GPU's in the same system to crunch hashes is already elite, and doing multiple sha-256 cores on a single FPGA would be child's play. And we already know that there is some elite talent within the Bitcoin community, some who desire to run it, and some who desire to break it.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (393 chars): The performance numbers posted from a VIA C7's hardware SHA-256 weren't astronomical. Only in the 1500 khash/s range. If you think about it, just because it's implemented in hardware doesn't mean it's crazy fast. It still has to do all the steps. It's only if simplifying it down to single-purpose hardware makes it small enough to fit many in parallel. That's not necessarily easy or a given.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (160 chars): I think not. I think that when a client considers a block bad it gets the transactions that were in it and rebroadcasts them or puts them in a block themselves.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (488 chars): That's right. You don't need to be re-broadcasting your transactions for it to work.<br/>When any node disconnects a fork, it dumps all the transactions from the fork back into the transaction pool to add to the new chain. The entire network is making sure to re-integrate your transactions again. All you should see is that your number of confirmations starts over from 0.<br/>In some types of forks, your transaction would have gotten into both forks already, so you're already good either way.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (788 chars): Instead of introducing a warning or establishing a precedence of caution and delay in handling wallet file or backups, as I suggested above, the implementation for backing up data/wallet file needs more thought/establishment.<br/>I am not familiar with the current process/structure of data flow that occurs, but if someone could write up or draw a diagram or something that shows how the flow of data appears then perhaps with this diagram-liek information, others, like myself, can help to understand how things work and maybe offer suggestions for improvements or to recognize things like after which data sent/received is worthy of implementing a kind of automated/triggered backup or similar action.<br/>see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=921.0 for continued discussion about backups</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (2095 chars): That's not the point, if I'm diligent enough to change a source code I'm also diligent enough to apply a -disablesafety switch which is much easier, the issue here is default behavior of the official client. Many people are going to just notice there is a new version, download and install it never realizing this new remote control was inserted there.<br/>Saying that they can examine the source code or that it was openly discussed on the forum is like Facebook saying "but we have an option to delete your account, it's in terms of service, section 76, line 346, under link named so-appalling-that-nobody-would-ever-click-it, then on page 2, just solve the capcha, confirm the dialog, that will disable your account and if you do not log in in a week it will be deleted". In short ... nobody actually does it ... that's how badware behaves and I do not want for Bitcoin to be badware.<br/>If there is a remote safety disable function every user who has it enabled should consciously enable it knowing what it does. This can be easily accomplished by presenting a dialog urging user to enable it while explaining what it does in a GUI client and presenting a warning accomplishing the same task when daemon is run. Simple, efficient and everybody is happy. That's how software that respects its users and is working for them should behave. I'm sure most people would enable it when understanding what it does ... but sneaking this feature in without making sure the user specifically wants it there is making decisions for the user, I do not like decisions being made for me<br/>I'm aware of this because I read the forums but what in the future? (And what about people who do not read forums) Will there be another "feature" inserted and I'm not going to be even notified, explained what it does and asked if I want it enabled? I do not like that if you ask me ... I want to know what software on my CPU does, if it doesn't make reasonable effort to inform me of that and assure that I'm aware of it's behavior I would consider it badware.<br/>That's at least my perspective ... and the fix is extremely easy</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1157 chars): It can't do arbitrary actions remotely. Maybe some of you are responding to other posters who suggested the alert system should do more?<br/>If there is an alert, the following json-rpc methods return an error:<br/>sendtoaddress<br/>getbalance<br/>getreceivedbyaddress<br/>getreceivedbylabel<br/>listreceivedbyaddress<br/>listreceivedbylabel<br/>The remaining 14 methods function as normal.<br/>I believe the safer option should be enabled by default. If you want your server to keep trading and ignore an alert saying the money its receiving might be like the money from the overflow bug, then you can use the switch and not blame anyone else if you lose your money.<br/>Worst case if you leave alerts enabled, your site stops trading until you upgrade or add the -disablesafemode switch.<br/>Getting surprised by some temporary down time when your node would otherwise be at risk is better than getting surprised by a thief draining all your inventory.<br/>Someday when we haven't found any new bugs for a long time and it has been thoroughly security reviewed without finding anything, this can be scaled back. I'm not arguing that this is the permanent way of things forever. It's still beta software.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (593 chars): DB_PRIVATE enables a few optimizations by making the assumption that only one process will access the db4 database. Notably, this flag enables db4 to use pthreads-style mutex locking rather than heavy, operating-system-provided flock and shared memory. Ref: DB_ENV-&gt;open documentation.<br/>The general motivation is that db4 databases can be safely accessed in parallel with bitcoin client, assuming (a) DB_PRIVATE is removed and (b) bitcoin properly uses db4 transactions. db4 transactions may even be employed to wrap around non-db4 data such as blk0001.dat, if the code is properly architected.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (585 chars): Trying it without the DB_PRIVATE flag in rev 153. We need to keep an eye on what's different.<br/>On Windows at least, it creates six __db.001 - __db.006 files with sizes from 24K to 4MB. It doesn't delete them on exit, it just leaves them behind.<br/>The docs say it uses memory mapped files. I assume they have the same file permissions as the database files, so the same user access restrictions apply.<br/>Tests on Windows private LAN download of 78500 blocks:<br/>with DB_PRIVATE 20 minutes 51 seconds<br/>without DB_PRIVATE 20 minutes 51 seconds<br/>I wasn't expecting them to come out exactly the same.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (417 chars): Speak now about this change or forever hold your peace... Satoshi will be including this functionality in the next version of Bitcoin (0.3.12).<br/>If you use the JSON-RPC api, you should check your error-condition-handling code; again, the changes are that the error member will be an Object (with 'code' and 'message' fields) instead of a String, and the HTTP status code may be 404 instead of 500 for method-not-found.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (770 chars): This is in SVN rev 147.<br/>This is more standard, and although json-rpc 1.0 didn't specify the format of error objects, it did specify that they would be objects not strings or other values, so we needed to change this to be correct. The code/message members have become standard in later json-rpc specs.<br/>If you have code that checks the error and expects a string, you'll need to change it. When there is an error, the error member is now an object not a string.<br/>Also in SVN rev 147:<br/>- The command line json-rpc returns the error code as its exit code. Exit codes can only be 0-255 on unix, so it's abs(code)%256.<br/>- The "backupwallet &lt;destination&gt;" command that was discussed in another thread. It locks the wallet and copies it, so you can be sure you get a correct copy.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (2576 chars): For a software like this, *only* GPL license makes any sense. It's not about an ideology but rather anyone who would trust proprietary software for their financial transactions and a system like bitcoin is a fool and deserves what's coming for them (which is a lot of stolen "cash"). Using proprietary software may even result in hijacking of the whole bitcoin network if significant portion of people would use such a client. There is no way to reliably test for backdoors or other nasty stuff, any closed-source software should be essentially banished by the bitcoin community. GPL allows you to make private in-house modification as much as you like so that's not an issue at all. The only situation that causes GPL to trigger is when you *distribute* the software to other people, in which case you have to provide sources along with it which is the only way anyone should accept any software dealing with bitcoin anyway.<br/>You have to also realize that there are no legal consequences to any "theft" as using bitcoin from neutral point of view is essentially just moving some arbitrary bits around. So the bitcoin community is expected to self-regulate, which should come in a form of an enforced transparency (by all the users rejecting anything else). Considering any other license than GPL-like is playing with fire and is not going to end well.<br/>I did not realize current bitcoin client was released under MIT license,<br/>This should be changed to GPL IMMEDIATELY!<br/>GPLv3 even protects you from said software to be locked up by DRM so even when it's open-source you would not have access to it. There is no disadvantage to using GPL license really. Anyone spreading FUD about GPL is either not appropriately informed/did not consider all the issues or has an ulterior motive as far as I'm concerned. I'm not going to trust any closed-source, that's for sure ... and if significant portion of the bitcoin community is, then I'm going to sell off all my bitcoins and get out as that's a prescription for disaster, sooner or later.<br/>As much as adoption is concerned, I'm not interested in people who feel the need to keep the source closed and hidden from its users to "adopt" anything as I would hope anyone concerned about the success and reliability of the bitcoin network wouldn't either. To complain about weak adoption in that sphere is like complaining about weak adoption by criminals to me. If someone is honest, they should feel no interest in keeping the source closed ... and every sane person would accept ONLY open-sourced software anyway. It's a win-win situation</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (469 chars): If the only library is closed source, then there's a project to make an open source one.<br/>If the only library is GPL, then there's a project to make a non-GPL one.<br/>If the best library is MIT, Boost, new-BSD or public domain, then we can stop re-writing it.<br/>I don't question that GPL is a good license for operating systems, especially since non-GPL code is allowed to interface with the OS. For smaller projects, I think the fear of a closed-source takeover is overdone.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (850 chars): The correct fee is so small right now that the psychological detriment far outweighs the benefits of charging it imo. It's like that damn place that charges me a quarter a tiny cup of water when I buy a $9 meal. Yes, I know there are costs to pressing the button, but now I don't like you anyway.<br/>I expect it will be a long time before a high % of nodes require a fee for normal transactions. This means most users will not attach a fee, being willing to wait 4 blocks on average or whatever. So for a good while charging a fee simply means not putting transactions in blocks, this will make bitcoin slightly less appealing and slightly reduce use which will slightly reduce the value of coins. So anyone who has coins can self interestedly include transactions for free.<br/>Jgarzik, do you have a guess as to the resource costs of a normal transaction?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (395 chars): Another option is to reduce the number of free transactions allowed per block before transaction fees are required. Nodes only take so many KB of free transactions per block before they start requiring at least 0.01 transaction fee.<br/>The threshold should probably be lower than it currently is.<br/>I don't think the threshold should ever be 0. We should always allow at least some free transactions.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1312 chars): Currently, paying a fee is controlled manually with the -paytxfee switch. It would be very easy to make the software automatically check the size of recent blocks to see if it should pay a fee. We're so far from reaching the threshold, we don't need that yet. It's a good idea to see how things go with controlling it manually first anyway.<br/>It's not a big deal if we reach the threshold. Free transactions would just take longer to get into a block.<br/>I did a rough tally of 4000 blocks from around 74000-78000. This is excluding the block reward transactions:<br/>There were average 2 transactions per block, 17 transactions per hour, 400 transactions per day.<br/>Average transaction bytes per block was 428 bytes, or 214 bytes per transaction.<br/>The current threshold is 200KB per block, or about 1000 transactions per block. I think it should be lowered to 50KB per block. That would still be more than 100 times the average transactions per block.<br/>The threshold can easily be changed in the future. We can decide to increase it when the time comes. It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed. If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use. Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (782 chars): I implemented this change in SVN rev 157.<br/>The reason I previously made it so high was to allow very large transactions without hitting the transaction fee. The threshold was around 26,000 BTC for transactions made of 50 BTC generated coins. Even though it was 100 times easier to generate back then, only a few people ever encountered the fee at that level. The new threshold puts it at around 11,000 BTC for sending generated coins. It would mostly only be reached with generated bitcoins. If you bought your bitcoins, they'll be denominated in larger transactions and won't be anywhere near the fee limit, unless you bought them in several hundred separate transactions. Even if you do reach the fee level, you only have to pay it once to bundle your little transactions together.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (897 chars): I have an unusual configuration: on my headless gateway there is bitcoind running and on my desktop standart bitcoin is running (both Linux OpenSuSE, gateway 11.1, desktop 11.3, bitcoin 0.3.12 both). TCP port 8333 forwarded on gateway to the desktop (so gateway client can't has incoming connections). I don't know why but when I start desktop client after gateway's one the desktop client can't connect and flickers between 0 and 2 connections for a long time. Eventually it may connect but while it can't the memory leaks badly. About 200Kb/sec (each 0-2 change). It may not be noticed if the client connects instantly but in my case it doesn't. If I start first the desktop and then the headless client (after the desktop one has connected) everything is fine and no leaks (or they are little enough). I guess there is unfreed memory in bootstrap function or somewhere in the bootstrap process.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (611 chars): Bouncing between 0 and 2 connections could be if it's connecting to itself. Are you using the "-connect" switch?<br/>Did you compile it or is this a release build, and what version?<br/>I'm not sure how the 200Kb/sec, since it waits at least a half second between connection attempts. How fast is it flickering between 0 and 2 connections? Faster than twice a second?<br/>The wait function on linux is:<br/>inline void Sleep(int64 n)<br/>{<br/>boost::thread::sleep(boost::get_system_time() + boost::posix_time::milliseconds(n));<br/>}<br/>If that doesn't work right, then it would be possible for it to spin through the loop as fast as it can.</p>

Ususally they have a fixed amount of pre-paid text messages that they can send each month which if the don't use are simply wasted. But they tend to forget that I still have to pay 25 cents whenever they send me a lousy spam text message!!!<br/>A smartphone bitcoin client with options for encrypted messaging would make for a great alternative text/sms system compared to the high fees charged by most wireless carriers for text messaging. Now, of course, I know of free text messaging apps, but they tend to contain ads. But with bitcoin, the small transaction fees for passing the message along would work as a great incentive instead...</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1292 chars): Probably best to disable receiving by IP unless you specifically intend to use it. This is a lot of surface area that nobody uses that doesn't need to be open by default.<br/>In storefront cases, you would typically only want customers to send payments through your automated system that only hands out bitcoin addresses associated with particular orders and accounts. Random unidentified payments volunteered to the server's IP address would be unhelpful.<br/>In general, sending by IP has limited useful cases. If connecting directly without a proxy, the man-in-the-middle risk may be tolerable, but no privacy. If you use a privacy proxy, man-in-the-middle risk is unacceptably high. If we went to all the work of implementing SSL, only large storefronts usually go to the trouble of getting a CA cert, but most of those cases would still be better off to use bitcoin addresses.<br/>I uploaded this change to SVN rev 156. The switch to enable is "-allowreceivebyip".<br/>Senders with this version will get the error "Recipient is not accepting transactions sent by IP address". Older version senders will get "Transfer was not accepted".<br/>I used a different name for the switch because "-allowiptransactions" sounds like it includes sending. If there's a better name for the switch, we can change it again.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (2167 chars): Summary: Giving BitCoin a decentralized escrow would give it an advantage over all other exchange mediums, which might increase its adoption rate. Details follow.<br/>For a decentralized currency, centralized escrows seem to be the norm for BitCoin today. An example:<br/>Alice wants to buy $5 USD worth of BitCoins from Bob, but neither Alice nor Bob fully trust the other, so they go to a site they both trust--say Mt. Gox. There they deposit their respective monies and there they have Mt. Gox make the exchange for them.<br/>No offense to Mt. Gox (a site I like), but can we do without its escrow service?<br/>An almost distributed alternative:<br/>Charlie, a trusted third-party, generates a BitCoin private key. Charlie then uses the Unix command split to split the private key in half--giving one half to Alice and one half to Bob. Bob deposits $5 USD worth of BitCoins into the split BitCoin account; Alice verifies the transaction using the public block; Alice sends $5 USD to Bob by PayPal; Bob verifies the PayPal transaction; Bob sends Alice his half of the split private key so Alice can access the BitCoins he deposited earlier.<br/>(For simplicity I omit part of the PayPal details like who pays the transaction fee and how long you should wait to avoid chargeback fraud. I also omit any incentive for Bob to perform the final step.)<br/>More advanced almost-distributed examples can be made if we substitute something more sophisticated for the Unix command split. For example: a Shamir's secret sharing scheme implementation like ssss[1]. A utility like ssss allows Alice and Bob to appoint an arbiter in case they get in a disagreement.<br/>The problem with all of this, of course, is that we must trust Charlie to not abuse the full copy of the private key he creates.<br/>The ideal solution would be for Alice and Bob to each generate half of the private key on their own. I don't fully understand the math used in modern keypairs, but I doubt this is possible with the current algorithm.<br/>Is there an alternative way for Alice and Bob to each acquire half of a private key without giving the whole key to any party?<br/>-Dave<br/>[1] See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (603 chars): It's not implemented yet, but the network can support a transaction that requires two signatures. It's described here:<br/>http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=750.0<br/>It's absolutely safer than a straight payment without escrow, but not as good as a human arbitrated escrow, assuming you trust the human enough.<br/>In this kind of escrow, a cheater can't win, but it's still possible for you to lose. It at least takes away the profit motive for cheating you. The seller is assured that the money is reserved for him, while the buyer retains the leverage that the seller hasn't been paid yet until completion.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1378 chars): As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation. 0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens. At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature.<br/>I made changes so they show up in lighter print, with the credit amount in square brackets like [+1.23], and the amount not counted towards your balance and not available for spending. This doesn't apply to transactions you sent, which you implicitly trust, since you wrote them.<br/>I didn't make it (+1.23) because parenthesis in accounting means negative. I hope square brackets is different enough to be clear what is meant.<br/>The JSON-RPC interface can still see 0/unconfirmed if it wants by specifying 0 confirmations.<br/>I uploaded the changes to SVN rev 158. I will post a 0.3.13 RC shortly.<br/>If you have any of these transactions in your wallet, do not send any payments until you've upgraded to 0.3.13, which will be coming soon.<br/>If you've already sent any of these transactions, or you're the creator of them, then use theymos' patch or make the following change and use it to send your clean transactions to a new wallet to clean things up.<br/>if (pcoin-&gt;GetDepthInMainChain() &lt; 1 && pcoin-&gt;GetDebit() &lt;= 0)<br/>continue;<br/>if (pcoin-&gt;GetDepthInMainChain() &lt; 1)<br/>continue;</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (361 chars): So in .13 1 confirm is good enough to pay someone with, but it takes 6 to display "confirmed" in the GUI. This is inconsistant. This coin is good enough to pay you with but not good enough for me to accept? I don't know the logic behind the 6, but whatever it is, if its only used to decide which word to display, then is it really representing anything at all?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (674 chars): That's going to be more of a SelectCoins thing.<br/>SVN rev 161 has a refinement to recursively determine if your own unconfirmed transactions can be spent. This is needed because you should be able to spend your own change right away.<br/>The new recursive determination is: 0/unconfirmed can be spent if it's yours and all its dependencies are either in a block or also yours.<br/>Here's a Windows build:<br/>http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13.2-win32-setup.exe<br/>This version is an improvement if you already had a 0/unconfirmed transaction and might have already spent it. If you were the original creator of a 0/unconfirmed transaction, you still need theymos' patch instead.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (343 chars): The fees are a function of total transaction volume.<br/>Right now the volume is pretty tiny so all fees are zero.<br/>Later when the volume is high only some of the current transactions will be included in each<br/>block so you either pay a fee to make sure your transaction is desirable to be in each block<br/>or wait until the trading volume drops.<br/>-Wayne</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (396 chars): It ramps up the fee requirement as the block fills up:<br/>&lt;50KB free<br/>50KB 0.01<br/>250KB 0.02<br/>333KB 0.03<br/>375KB 0.04<br/>etc.<br/>It's a typical pricing mechanism. After the first 50KB sells out, the price is raised to 0.01. After 250KB is sold, it goes up to 0.02. At some price, you can pretty much always get in if you're willing to outbid the other customers.<br/>Just including the minimum 0.01 goes a long way.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (279 chars): ArtForz is already running with no fees, and he has 20-30% of the network's CPU power. The person who originally sent the broken transactions deleted his wallet, though, and the network has forgotten these historical transactions, so any transactions based on this won't confirm.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (697 chars): Transactions aren't accepted or displayed as 0/unconfirmed until your node has a path of transactions back to the block chain.<br/>Any transactions in your wallet also have bundled with them all unrecorded transactions required to reach the block chain. If you have a transaction that is displayed as 0/unconfirmed, then you have all the previous unrecorded transactions it depends on and you will also rebroadcast those transactions when you rebroadcast yours.<br/>If a no-fee block has already been generated and hasn't helped, then I need to look at what's wrong. It's a part of code that doesn't get much use. They should be recorded in the wallets of everyone who has a transaction depending on them.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (196 chars): When you generate, you calculate hashes of the block header. Hashing more data is slower than hashing less data, so the block header is critically of a fixed size for everyone, with one exception.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (764 chars): This is the point of confusion. extraNonce is not part of the block header, it is part of the first transaction. It does not slow down your hashing. It does not change the size of the header.<br/>We need to be vigilant and nip in the bud any misconception that the contents of your block slows down your hash speed. It doesn't.<br/>extraNonce never needs to be very big. We could reset it every second whenever the time changes if we wanted. Worst case, if you didn't want to keep track of incrementing it, extraNonce could be 4 random bytes and the chance of wasting time from collision would be negligible.<br/>Separate machines are automatically collision proof because they have different generated public keys in the first transaction. That also goes for each thread too.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (451 chars): With davidonpda's help, I did some testing myself today with Satoshi's latest code changes (setting priority based on transaction age, bitcoin amounts in, and total transaction size in bytes -- svn rev 176).<br/>It behaved as expected, putting larger, older transactions ahead of the pennies being flooded into the network, so "normal" transactions will be confirmed promptly even if somebody decides to be a jerk and floods the network with transactions.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (785 chars): Thank you for limiting flood tests to the testnet.<br/>Version 0.3.15 combines several features to help legitimate transactions jump the queue during a flood attack. The key was Gavin's idea for prioritising transactions based on the age of their dependencies. Every coin is entitled to turn over so often. The longer waited, the more priority accumulates. Priority is sum(valuein * age) / txsize. Transaction fee still takes precedence over priority, and priority determines the order of processing within a fee strata.<br/>In support of the priority feature, SelectCoins only uses your own 0 conf transactions only as a last resort if that's all you have left. This helps keep you from turning your coins over rapidly unless you're forcing it by actually turning all your coins over rapidly.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (280 chars): Of course, if the network is not being flooded and you're not overly concerned about the current transaction getting held up then it's probably worth preferring to use your 0 conf transactions so that you can "save" the higher priority coins for when the network is being flooded.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (237 chars): You should use at least some priority in case a flood comes along before the next block.<br/>As long as all dependencies have at least 1 conf, if the transaction doesn't have enough priority at first, the dependencies will age until it does.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (140 chars): Gaming the system by including 1000 or so recently turned over BTC to bump the priority as described in my post above still works of course!</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (492 chars): Or managing how much priority you spend on a transaction. The software would have to know your future plans to know whether to spend your priority now or save it for later. I don't think we'll need to get into that much detail though. There's a wide enough difference between normal users and flooders.<br/>Priority doesn't have to do everything. Once you know there's a flood, you can add -paytxfee=0.01. Hopefully with priority, your transactions before that should be at worst slow, not stuck.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (807 chars): We can't safely do OP_BLOCKNUMBER. In the event of a block chain reorg after a segmentation, transactions need to be able to get into the chain in a later block. The OP_BLOCKNUMBER transaction and all its dependants would become invalid. This wouldn't be fair to later owners of the coins who weren't involved in the time limited transaction.<br/>nTimeLock does the reverse. It's an open transaction that can be replaced with new versions until the deadline. It can't be recorded until it locks. The highest version when the deadline hits gets recorded. It could be used, for example, to write an escrow transaction that will automatically permanently lock and go through unless it is revoked before the deadline. The feature isn't enabled or used yet, but the support is there so it could be implemented later.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1111 chars): I think it would be possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate network and separate block chain, yet share CPU power with Bitcoin. The only overlap is to make it so miners can search for proof-of-work for both networks simultaneously.<br/>The networks wouldn't need any coordination. Miners would subscribe to both networks in parallel. They would scan SHA such that if they get a hit, they potentially solve both at once. A solution may be for just one of the networks if one network has a lower difficulty.<br/>I think an external miner could call getwork on both programs and combine the work. Maybe call Bitcoin, get work from it, hand it to BitDNS getwork to combine into a combined work.<br/>Instead of fragmentation, networks share and augment each other's total CPU power. This would solve the problem that if there are multiple networks, they are a danger to each other if the available CPU power gangs up on one. Instead, all networks in the world would share combined CPU power, increasing the total strength. It would make it easier for small networks to get started by tapping into a ready base of miners.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (269 chars): seems that the miner would have to basically do "extra work". and if there's no reward from the bitdns mining from the extra work (which of course, slows down the main bitcoin work), what would be a miner's incentive to include bitdns (and whatever other side chains) ?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1323 chars): The incentive is to get the rewards from the extra side chains also for the same work.<br/>While you are generating bitcoins, why not also get free domain names for the same work?<br/>If you currently generate 50 BTC per week, now you could get 50 BTC and some domain names too.<br/>You have one piece of work. If you solve it, it will solve a block from both Bitcoin and BitDNS. In concept, they're tied together by a Merkle Tree. To hand it in to Bitcoin, you break off the BitDNS branch, and to hand it in to BitDNS, you break off the Bitcoin branch.<br/>In practice, to retrofit it for Bitcoin, the BitDNS side would have to have maybe ~200 extra bytes, but that's not a big deal. You've been talking about 50 domains per block, which would dwarf that little 200 bytes per block for backward compatibility. We could potentially schedule a far in future block when Bitcoin would upgrade to a modernised arrangement with the Merkle Tree on top, if we care enough about saving a few bytes.<br/>Note that the chains are below this new Merkle Tree. That is, each of Bitcoin and BitDNS have their own chain links inside their blocks. This is inverted from the common timestamp server arrangement, where the chain is on top and then the Merkle Tree, because that creates one common master chain. This is two timestamp servers not sharing a chain.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (77 chars): Got you now. Yes, keeping two chains synchronised is fraught with difficulty.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1078 chars): Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale.<br/>Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately. Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other. BitDNS users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either.<br/>The networks need to have separate fates. BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.<br/>Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It's easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-repudiable commodities.<br/>If you're still worried about it, it's cryptographically possible to make a risk free trade. The two parties would set up transactions on both sides such that when they both sign the transactions, the second signer's signature triggers the release of both. The second signer can't release one without releasing the other.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (273 chars): additional block chains would each create their own flavor of coins, which would trade with bitcoins on exchanges? These chain-specific coins would be used to reward miners on those chains, and to purchase some kinds of rights or privileges within the domain of that chain?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (930 chars): Right, the exchange rate between domains and bitcoins would float.<br/>A longer interval than 10 minutes would be appropriate for BitDNS.<br/>So far in this discussion there's already a lot of housekeeping data required. It will be much easier if you can freely use all the space you need without worrying about paying fees for expensive space in Bitcoin's chain. Some transactions:<br/>Changing the IP record.<br/>Name change. A domain object could entitle you to one domain, and you could change it at will to any name that isn't taken. This would encourage users to free up names they don't want anymore. Generated domains start out blank and the miner sells it to someone who changes it to what they want.<br/>Renewal. Could be free, or maybe require consuming another domain object to renew. In that case, domain objects (domaincoins?) could represent the right to own a domain for a year. The spent fee goes to the miners in the next block fee.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (728 chars): OK so if there are going to be bitdnscoins (aka DCCs, DomainChain Coins) then they have to be useful for something. Otherwise every BitDNS miner is going to fill every block with his own domain name registrations, rather than replace one with someone else's registration in exchange for a transaction fee in a useless currency.<br/>The rules have to be that you have to spend a certain amount of bitdnscoins/DCCs in order to register your names and/or do other BitDNS transactions. That's the only way to make this alternative currency desirable and valuable.<br/>(Well we could do like Bitcoin and say there would only ever be 22 million DCCs ever created, so they'd get valuable from scarcity just like bitcoins. But that seems weak.)</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (364 chars): I agree. All transactions, IP changes, renewals, etc. should have some fee that goes to the miners.<br/>You might consider a certain amount of work to generate a domain, instead of a fixed total circulation. The work per domain could be on a schedule that grows with Moore's Law. That way the number of domains would grow with demand and the number of people using it.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (554 chars): Perhaps in addition to the age priority rule recently implimented, there should be a minimum age rule without a transaction fee. Said another way, perhaps a generation rule that says that a free transaction must be 3 blocks deep before it can be transfered again for free. This will still allow real users to immediately spend new funds if they have to, while still permitting real users to reshuffle funds to suit their needs without an overhead cost. I think that this would significantly inhibit the type of spamming attack that is currently underway.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (507 chars): As it stands now 3.15 has a lot of free transaction space and that space is given first to transactions with the highest [age]*[value]/[size] correct? Would it be reasonable to make some arbitrary portion of the free space require [age]*[value]/[size] &gt; C ?<br/>Maybe set C so that a standard 1BTC transaction can get into the main free area on the next block. And a .1 can get in after waiting about 10 blocks. And make the area which allows [age]*[value]/[size] &lt; C to let in about a dozen transactions or so.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1069 chars): Yes, like this. And the no-priority-requirement area is 3K, about a dozen transactions per block.<br/>I just uploaded SVN rev 185 which has a minimal priority requirement for free transactions. Transaction floods are made up of coins that are re-spent over and over, so they depend on their own 0 conf transactions repeatedly. 0 conf transactions have 0 priority, so free transactions like that will have to wait for one transaction to get into a block at a time.<br/>Version 0.3.15 doesn't write transactions using 0 conf dependencies unless that's all it has left, so normal users shouldn't usually have a problem with this.<br/>I think this is a good compromise short of making the default fee 0.01. It's not so much to ask that free transactions can only be used to turn coins over so often. If you're using free transactions, you're taking charity and there has to be some limit on how often you can use it with the same coins.<br/>We've always said free transactions may be processed more slowly. You can help ensure your transactions go through quickly by adding -paytxfee=0.01.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (163 chars): I suspect something weird going on with ByteReverse (or lack thereof). It's quite unclear whether or not 'data' and 'nonce' must be byte-reversed, and in what way.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (856 chars): getwork does the byte-reversing. midstate, data and hash1 are already big-endian, and you pass data back still big-endian, so you work in big-endian and don't have to do any byte-reversing. They're the same data that is passed to the ScanHash_ functions. You can take midstate, data and hash1, put them in 16-byte aligned buffers and pass them to a ScanHash_ function, like ScanHash(pmidstate, pdata + 64, phash1, nHashesDone). If a nonce is found, patch it into data and call getwork.<br/>I should probably change the ScanHash_ functions to use pdata instead of pdata + 64 so they're consistent.<br/>target is little endian, it's supposed to be the same as how m0mchil's did it. (if it's not, then it should be fixed) That's the only case where you would use byte reverse. I think you do it like: if ByteReverse((unsigned int*)hash[6]) &lt; (unsigned int*)target[6].</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (417 chars): Indeed, shipping the data with the client is just a kludge.<br/>If the main reason that the bitcoin P2P protocol is so inefficient in transferring large amounts of blocks, that should be fixed. I think that's because of the HDD syncing going on. Maybe this should be held off for the initial download, or the protocol should be made more bittorrent-like for the blocks [0..last-10000], as they are basically set in stone.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (797 chars): It's not the downloading that takes the time, it's verifying and indexing it.<br/>Bandwidthwise, it's more efficient than if you downloaded an archive. Bitcoin only downloads the data in blk0001.dat, which is currently 55MB, and builds blkindex.dat itself, which is 47MB. Building blkindex.dat is what causes all the disk activity.<br/>During the block download, it only flushes the database to disk every 500 blocks. You may see the block count pause at ??499 and ??999. That's when it's flushing.<br/>Doing your own verifying and indexing is the only way to be sure your index data is secure. If you copy blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat from an untrusted source, there's no way to know if you can trust all the contents in them.<br/>Maybe Berkeley DB has some tweaks we can make to enable or increase cache memory.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1050 chars): Which of the ACID properties do you need, while downloading?<br/>Adding BDB records is simply appending to a log file, until you issue a checkpoint. The checkpoint then updates the main database file.<br/>Under a normal BDB transaction, you are guaranteed that each log record will be sync'd to disk platter, before the transaction commit succeeds. This is very strict, but required for full ACID. Enabling DB_TXN_NOSYNC still gives you a lot:<br/>"database integrity will be maintained, but if the application or system fails, it is possible<br/>some number of the most recently committed transactions may be undone during recovery"<br/>bitcoin can obviously recover if recent transactions are undone, so, it seems useful for this flag to be set for 100% of the initial block download.<br/>That leaves checkpointing, which is a balance between amount of work performed at checkpoint time -- number of records that must be copied from log to database file -- and wall clock time. Just gotta try some values and see what "feels" right -- maybe checkpoint every 10,000 blocks?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (717 chars): I tested it on a slow 7 year old drive, where bandwidth and CPU were clearly not the bottleneck. Initial download took 1 hour 20 minutes.<br/>If it's taking a lot longer than that, certainly 24 hours, then it must be downloading from a very slow node, or your connection is much slower than around 15KB per sec (120kbps), or something else is wrong. It would be nice to know what appears to be the bottleneck when that happens.<br/>Every 10 minutes or so when the latest block is sent, it should have the chance to change to a faster node. When the latest block is broadcast, it requests the next 500 blocks from other nodes, and continues the download from the one that sends it fastest. At least, that's how it should work.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (467 chars): It may only need more read caching. It has to read randomly all over blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat to index. It can't assume the file is smaller than memory, although it currently still is.

      <p><b>User</b> (870 chars): My understanding was that the client already did a blockchain recheck upon startup if the index was missing. I did this when I first started, and it sure seemed like it was marching through the chain. Doesn't it require an index to function anyway? Why would it assume that the blockchain was valid upon startup? Anyone could have edited it. The genesis block is encoded into the client, isn't it? That and the blockchain checkpoints are the only parts that are assumed correct, or am I wrong? There is no good reason to prevent a blockchain download via other methods. In a future with the bitcoin network running close to it's capacity, downloading the entire blockchain over the P2P network will be harmful.<br/>Even a chain that has already been pruned of it's merkle trees should be able to be verified from the start, otherwise what good is using a merkle tree at all?</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1052 chars): I think I initially misunderstood the blocks in that the hashes that we compute are independent of the address. Now, I believe that we are looking for something like sha256 (bitcoint address + amount (I am not sure whether the value is implicit, so this value might not be there) + &lt;answer&gt;) with some desired properties (of which the number of final zeros is an approximation), where + means some concatenation operator of bits.<br/>If the computation is like that, _then_ it might work, but I don't see why someone cannot just only send you the worthless hashes (for you) and don't send those that are useful to you. By this mechanism they can bankrupt you. Anyway, I think it is a bad way to communicate with natural language only about these topics. Just write out the computations that you intend to do on the server and the client and then we can see whether it is a brilliant idea or a flawed one. Annotations on the computations as to which goal they intend to achieve is also useful for communication.<br/>Forcing cooperation out of nodes is not easy.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1397 chars): ribuck's description is spot on.<br/>Pool operators can modify their getwork to take one additional parameter, the address to send your share to.<br/>The easy way for the pool operator would be to wait until the next block is found and divy it up proportionally as:<br/>user's near-hits/total near-hits from everyone<br/>That would be easier and safer to start up. It also has the advantage that multiple hits from the same user can be combined into one transaction. A lot of your hits will usually be from the same people.<br/>The instant gratification way would be to pay a fixed amount for each near-hit immediately, and the operator takes the risk from randomness of having more or less near-hits before a block is found.<br/>Either way, the user who submits the hit that solves the block should get an extra amount off the top, like 10 BTC.<br/>New users wouldn't really even need the Bitcoin software. They could download a miner, create an account on mtgox or mybitcoin, enter their deposit address into the miner and point it at anyone's pool server. When the miner says it found something, a while later a few coins show up in their account.<br/>Miner writers better make sure they never false-positive near-hits. Users will depend on that to check if the pool operator is cheating them. If the miner wrongly says it found something, users will look in their account, not find anything, and get mad at the pool operator.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1455 chars): It's not safe to use listtransactions this way.<br/>I know I've been criticized for being reluctant about listtransactions. Let me explain my reluctance.<br/>Transactions are dynamic. Past transactions can become unconfirmed, go away and come back, become invalid and disappear, or be replaced by a different double-spend. Their date can change, their order can change.<br/>Programmers are naturally inclined to want to use listtransactions like this: feed me the new transactions since I last asked, and I'll keep my own tally or static record of them. This will seem to work in all regular use, but if you use the amounts for anything, it is highly exploitable:<br/>1) How do you know if a past transaction becomes invalid and disappears?<br/>2) When there's a block-chain reorg, it would be easy to double-count transactions when they get confirmed again.<br/>3) A transaction can be replaced by a double-spend with a different txid. You would count both spends.<br/>The model where you assume you only need to see new transactions because you've already seen previous transactions is not true. Old transactions can change at any time.<br/>Any time you take an action based on payment amounts received, you always need to go back to bitcoin and ask for a current balance total (or use move or sendfrom), and be ready for the possibility that it can go down.<br/>Now that we have the Accounts feature making it easier to do it the right way, we're better prepared to have listtransactions.</p>

After that binary decisionpoint, even if the block chain is reorg'd or transactions disappear, there is nothing the website can do but take a loss (or pursue a refund outside of bitcoin).<br/>From the website's point of view, there is zero effective difference between 'listtransactions 6' and 'listreceivedbyaddress 6', because the end result to the website operator is the same: the goods have been shipped / order accepted / money exchanged.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (1296 chars): Several months ago, around the time when the 0.3.9 bugs were found, I privately told Satoshi that I thought whitelisting acceptable transaction types was a better way to go, rather than blacklisting transaction types that we find out cause problems.<br/>The danger is similar websites that try to blacklist &lt;script&gt; tags in HTML entered by users to prevent cross-site-scripting hacks. See http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html for a nice sampling of how creative hackers can be.<br/>I haven't asked Satoshi if the recent discussion of BitDNS putting extra data in the block chain swayed his opinion or if he woke up in the middle of the night and realized that a creative use of OP_SOMETHING might lead to an exploit. I don't think it matters; I'm still convinced that whitelisting acceptable transaction types is the right thing to do.<br/>As for "the above option was thrown out by the developers" -- nothing has been thrown out! Again, I haven't talked to Satoshi, but I'm open to the idea of a third 'standard' transaction type that includes extra, arbitrary data. Lets have that discussion, implement it on the -testnet, poke at it, try to imagine all the possible ways it can be misused, try to estimate the benefits and costs... and if there's general consensus that it is a good idea, roll it into production.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (59 chars): See the discussion of locktime for transaction replacement.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1122 chars): Not locktime.<br/>There's a possible design for far in the future:<br/>You intentionally write a double-spend. You write it with the same inputs and outputs, but this time with a fee. When your double-spend gets into a block, the first spend becomes invalid. The payee does not really notice, because at the moment the new transaction becomes valid, the old one becomes invalid, and the new transaction simply takes its place.<br/>It's easier said than implemented. There would be a fair amount of work to make a client that correctly writes the double-spend, manages the two versions in the wallet until one is chosen, handles all the corner cases. Every assumption in the existing code is that you're not trying to write double-spends.<br/>There would need to be some changes on the Bitcoin Miner side also, to make the possibility to accept a double-spend into the transaction pool, but only strictly if the inputs and outputs match and the transaction fee is higher. Currently, double-spends are never accepted into the transaction pool, so every node bears witness to which transaction it saw first by working to put it into a block.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (748 chars): We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.<br/><br/>For transferable proof of work tokens to have value, they must have monetary value. To have monetary value, they must be transferred within a very large network - for example a file trading network akin to bittorrent.<br/><br/>To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1234 chars): Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.<br/><br/>The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.<br/><br/>If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.</p>

People I know who run a blacklist of spam sending zombies tell me they often see a million new zombies a day.<br/><br/>This is the same reason that hashcash can't work on today's Internet -- the good guys have vastly less computational firepower than the bad guys.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1404 chars): Thanks for bringing up that point.<br/><br/>I didn't really make that statement as strong as I could have. The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single attacker.<br/><br/>There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins. The smaller farms are then the "honest nodes". (I need a better term than "honest") The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too. According to the "long tail" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.<br/><br/>Even if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly rich. All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check. To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back. I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins. With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.<br/><br/>The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (161 chars): the "currency" is inflationary at about 35% as that's how much faster computers get annually ... the inflation rate of 35% is almost guaranteed by the technology</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1053 chars): Increasing hardware speed is handled: "To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases." As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant. Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future.<br/><br/>The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation. If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase.<br/><br/>Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (554 chars): it is mentioned that if a broadcast transaction does not reach all nodes, it is OK, as it will get into the block chain before long. How does this happen - what if the node that creates the "next" block (the first node to find the hashcash collision) did not hear about the transaction, and then a few more blocks get added also by nodes that did not hear about that transaction? Do all the nodes that did hear it keep that transaction around, hoping to incorporate it into a block once they get lucky enough to be the one which finds the next collision?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (192 chars): Right, nodes keep transactions in their working set until they get into a block. If a transaction reaches 90% of nodes, then each time a new block is found, it has a 90% chance of being in it.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (372 chars): Or for example, what if a node is keeping two or more chains around as it waits to see which grows fastest, and a block comes in for chain A which would include a double-spend of a coin that is in chain B? Is that checked for or not? (This might happen if someone double-spent and two different sets of nodes heard about the two different transactions with the same coin.)</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (523 chars): That does not need to be checked for. The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid. If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.<br/><br/>Receivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved. They can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait before taking an action such as shipping goods.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (649 chars): I also don't understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster more computing power than all the honest participants. I see that he can create new blocks and add them to create the longest chain, but how can he erase or add old transactions in the chain? As the attacker sends out his new blocks, aren't there consistency checks which honest nodes can perform, to make sure that nothing got erased? More explanation of this attack would be helpful, in order to judge the gains to an attacker from this, versus simply using his computing power to mint new coins honestly.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1074 chars): The attacker isn't adding blocks to the end. He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that. He's rewriting history. Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.<br/><br/>This touches on a key point. Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact.<br/><br/>It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one. Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this. We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened. The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (757 chars): The core concept is that lots of entities keep complete and consistent information as to who owns which bitcoins.<br/><br/>But maintaining consistency is tricky. It is not clear to me what happens when someone reports one transaction to one maintainer, and someone else transports another transaction to another maintainer. The transaction cannot be known to be valid until it has been incorporated into a globally shared view of all past transactions, and no one can know that a globally shared view of all past transactions is globally shared until after some time has passed, and after many new transactions have arrived.<br/><br/>Did you explain how to do this, and it just passed over my head, or were you confident it could be done, and a bit vague as to the details?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1635 chars): The proof-of-work chain is the solution to the synchronisation problem, and to knowing what the globally shared view is without having to trust anyone.<br/><br/>A transaction will quickly propagate throughout the network, so if two versions of the same transaction were reported at close to the same time, the one with the head start would have a big advantage in reaching many more nodes first. Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working on incorporating it into the next proof-of-work. In effect, each node votes for its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its proof-of-work effort.<br/><br/>If the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides which is valid.<br/><br/>When a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block after it. Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.<br/><br/>The proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view. Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work. Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has approved. Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (336 chars): OK, suppose one node incorporates a bunch of transactions in its proof of work, all of them honest legitimate single spends and another node incorporates a different bunch of transactions in its proof of work, all of them equally honest legitimate single spends, and both proofs are generated at about the same time.<br/><br/>What happens then?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (910 chars): They both broadcast their blocks. All nodes receive them and keep both, but only work on the one they received first. We'll suppose exactly half received one first, half the other.<br/><br/>In a short time, all the transactions will finish propagating so that everyone has the full set. The nodes working on each side will be trying to add the transactions that are missing from their side. When the next proof-of-work is found, whichever previous block that node was working on, that branch becomes longer and the tie is broken. Whichever side it is, the new block will contain the other half of the transactions, so in either case, the branch will contain all transactions. Even in the unlikely event that a split happened twice in a row, both sides of the second split would contain the full set of transactions anyway.<br/><br/>It's not a problem if transactions have to wait one or a few extra cycles to get into a block.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (468 chars): If you're having trouble with the inflation issue, it's easy to tweak it for transaction fees instead. It's as simple as this: let the output value from any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value. Either the client software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side. The incentive value when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in the block.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (269 chars): It is not sufficient that everyone knows X. We also need everyone to know that everyone knows X, and that everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows X - which, as in the Byzantine Generals problem, is the classic hard problem of distributed data processing.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (2407 chars): The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem. I'll try to rephrase it in that context.<br/><br/>A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain number of characters in length. Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble. They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.<br/><br/>They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree. It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time. The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.<br/><br/>They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash. The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution. Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they're working on. If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.<br/><br/>After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time. They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.<br/><br/>The proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database and global view problems you've asked about are solved.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (224 chars): I think it is necessary that nodes keep a separate pending-transaction list associated with each candidate chain.<br/><br/>... One might also ask ... how many candidate chains must a given node keep track of at one time, on average?</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (702 chars): Fortunately, it's only necessary to keep a pending-transaction pool for the current best branch. When a new block arrives for the best branch, ConnectBlock removes the block's transactions from the pending-tx pool. If a different branch becomes longer, it calls DisconnectBlock on the main branch down to the fork, returning the block transactions to the pending-tx pool, and calls ConnectBlock on the new branch, sopping back up any transactions that were in both branches. It's expected that reorgs like this would be rare and shallow.<br/><br/>With this optimisation, candidate branches are not really any burden. They just sit on the disk and don't require attention unless they ever become the main chain.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (634 chars): Broadcasts will probably be almost completely reliable. TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days, and the broadcast protocol has a retry mechanism to get the data from other nodes after a while. If broadcasts turn out to be slower in practice than expected, the target time between blocks may have to be increased to avoid wasting resources. We want blocks to usually propagate in much less time than it takes to generate them, otherwise nodes would spend too much time working on obsolete blocks.<br/><br/>I'm planning to run an automated test with computers randomly sending payments to each other and randomly dropping packets.</p>

We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid. Receivers of transactions must wait a few blocks to make sure that resolution has had time to complete.

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (772 chars): If you're thinking of it as a CPU-intensive digital signing, then you may be thinking of a race to finish a long operation first and the fastest always winning.<br/><br/>The proof-of-work is a Hashcash style SHA-256 collision finding. It's a memoryless process where you do millions of hashes a second, with a small chance of finding one each time. The 3 or 4 fastest nodes' dominance would only be proportional to their share of the total CPU power. Anyone's chance of finding a solution at any time is proportional to their CPU power.<br/><br/>There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can.

It would only take something like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough that a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing very many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.<br/><br/>During those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a double-spent transaction. The double-spender would not be able to blast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant getting it, so he has to wait before starting.<br/><br/>If the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches 10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90% chance his money gets spent. For almost any type of goods, that's not going to be worth it for the scammer.<br/><br/>Information based goods like access to website or downloads are non-fencible. Nobody is going to be able to make a living off stealing access to websites or downloads. They can go to the file sharing networks to steal that. Most instant-access products aren't going to have a huge incentive to steal.<br/><br/>If a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the customer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many already do. If they really want to optimize, and it's a large download, they could cancel the download in the middle if the transaction comes back double-spent. If it's website access, typically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access for 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected. Many such sites have a free trial anyway.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (223 chars): I mean a node only needs the pending-tx pool for the best branch it has. The branch that it currently thinks is the best branch.<br/><br/>That's the branch it'll be trying to make a block out of, which is all it needs the pool for.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (188 chars): Rather than assuming that each message arrives at least once, we have to make a mechanism such that the information arrives even though conveyed by messages that frequently fail to arrive.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (675 chars): I think I've got the peer networking broadcast mechanism covered.<br/><br/>Each node sends its neighbours an inventory list of hashes of the new blocks and transactions it has. The neighbours request the items they don't have yet. If the item never comes through after a timeout, they request it from another neighbour that had it. Since all or most of the neighbours should eventually have each item, even if the coms get fumbled up with one, they can get it from any of the others, trying one at a time.<br/><br/>The inventory-request-data scheme introduces a little latency, but it ultimately helps speed more by keeping extra data blocks off the transmit queues and conserving bandwidth.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (151 chars): Yea, that was the primary feature that caught my eye. The real trick will be to get people to actually value the BitCoins so that they become currency.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1422 chars): I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party gets cold feet.<br/><br/>It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications for services that could almost be free but not quite.<br/><br/>It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.<br/><br/>It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and give out the IP address on their website. "Send X bitcoins to my priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally." Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge bitcoins for the trial.<br/><br/>It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (468 chars): If POW tokens do become useful, and especially if they become money, machines will no longer sit idle. Users will expect their computers to be earning them money (assuming the reward is greater than the cost to operate). A computer whose earnings are being stolen by a botnet will be more noticeable to its owner than is the case today, hence we might expect that in that world, users will work harder to maintain their computers and clean them of botnet infestations.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (1081 chars): there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from spam. They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the message. The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become too high for spam to be cost effective.<br/><br/>The process has the potential to establish the POW token's value in the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could buy tokens from harvesters. While the buying back would temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the spammers.<br/><br/>Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of spam called "dusting". Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.<br/><br/>If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a message with it, users could set how much they're willing to get paid to receive spam.</p>

      <p><b>User</b> (213 chars): That sounds good. I'd also like to be able to run multiple coin/block generators on multiple machines, all behind a single NAT address. I haven't tried this yet so I don't know if it works on the current software.</p>
      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (492 chars): The current version will work fine. They'll each connect over the Internet, while incoming connections only come to the host that port 8333 is routed to.<br/><br/>As an optimisation, I'll make a switch "-connect=1.2.3.4" to make it only connect to a specific address. You could make your extra nodes connect to your primary, and only the primary connects over the Internet. It doesn't really matter for now, since the network would have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than trivial.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (242 chars): Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for transactions. A few lines of code could create a transaction with an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.<br/><br/>I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.</p>

      <p><b>Satoshi</b> (402 chars): I haven't had any reports of crashes in v0.1.5. It's been rock solid for me on Windows. I think it must be Wine related.

# Satoshi-data

This project curates part of the dataset collected by NakamotoInstitute for [nakamotoinstitute.org](https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.org/tree/master/data). Particularly the [posts.json](https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.org/blob/master/data/posts.json) and [emails.json](https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.org/blob/master/data/emails.json).

They are cleaned up, merged and re-assemble into Q&As answered by Satoshi Nakamoto. The data is used by the API powering [satoshi-ama](https://github.com/flesler/satoshi-ama) to answer user questions.

In addition, the final JSON includes several questions generated by GPT-4, that are answered by literal quotes from Satoshi Nakamoto.

You can view the dataset here: https://flesler.github.io/satoshi-data/

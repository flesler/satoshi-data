# Satoshi-data

Curated dataset of Satoshi Nakamoto responding to users

## What is this?

This project curates part of the dataset collected by NakamotoInstitute for [nakamotoinstitute.org](https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.org/tree/master/data). Particularly the [posts.json](https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.org/blob/master/data/posts.json) and [emails.json](https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.org/blob/master/data/emails.json).

The data is cleaned up, merged and re-assembled into Q&As answered by Satoshi Nakamoto. The Q&A data is used by the API powering [satoshi-ama](https://github.com/flesler/satoshi-ama) to answer user questions.

In addition, the final JSON includes several questions generated by GPT-4, they are all answered by literal quotes from Satoshi Nakamoto.

I aimed to keep the original dataset intact, so all modifications are recorded in [inputs/overrides.json](inputs/overrides.json) and even those don't change the original text, just re-arrange it. It still needs some more cleaning up but I won't be doing that in the short-term.
